Lithium deal is not exclusive ; has many contingencies. The press on this matter is unwarranted.
Liquid nitrogen cryogenic strength test underway
Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings
Manganese also requires less lithium, as it operates at higher voltage
Releasing to Early Access Program Tesla owners next week
Side boosters landing on droneships ; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.
yes, from F to F
Truth is a metaphorical concept with no footwear or clothing of anything kind. Also, baby dont hurt me haha
He taunts us with his speed
Truth is stranger than fiction
Center engines gimbal to degrees
Appreciate thoughtful article. Faith in restored.
to months after that
Youre most welcome!
Frictionless AI. What could possibly go wrong?
Model X pulls a lb (15,000 above US road legal limit) semi truck on a pure snow surface
Not in current plans, but that may change
Minimizing $/ton to the surface of Mars is the fundamental optimization
Definitely
Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in D fast, but immune to weather, quiet and no risk cars fall on your head
Important
This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers.
*cooling haha
No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.
Warren Buffet Sizzler buffet
Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs
There will always be upgrades
Pretty much
This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
And, yes, I do in fact know that this sounds crazy. That is not lost on me. Nor I do think SpaceX will do this alone.
Indeed
Mars is my souldog
years ago, when my st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 ; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way
All the answers to questions you never asked about holes in the ground
Ok
Babies rock
There are redundant pressure control valves. Its a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
Stop! In the name of love
There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
I dare you to stop following me. Do it.
Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ...
Worth another retweet. Hope Dan Neil returns to Twitter. He left due to relentless attacks from short-sellers, who constantly peddle fear, uncertainty ; doubt about Tesla. Dan won the Pulitzer ; is considered by many to be the best car critic in the world.
DKE^DKE
Yes
Impressive
If we make life multiplanetary, there may come a day when some plants ; animals die out on Earth, but are still alive on Mars
Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time. Bodes well for the future tho.
Sure, Im planning on meeting community supporters around the presentation on the th. Thanks!
(Sigh) I do like Ty, but shes a friend. We are not dating.
Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. Were fixing it now.
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
And Rammstein
When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe theres a good reason that isnt obvious.
Another Starlinks reach orbit
Such a beautiful day to launch
If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles ; each does tons to orbit, thats a capacity of million tons of payload to orbit per year
No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer
Does seem a bit high
Thanks to a lot of great Autopilot/AI hardware ; software engineers at Tesla!
China understands the profound importance of reusability. The era of expendable rockets will soon be over.
Wow, lot of interest in FSD beta! Plan is to roll out version midnight Friday, then on-ramp ~1000 owners/day, prioritized by safety rating.
Feels weird helping make (hopefully good version of) Cyberpunk come true
Feels so long ago
S3XY
Haha true
NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs.
Maybe wont need a key at all
Yup
Ok
Oh stop teasing, Jeff
Nomad
Meme of recursive irony
Tesla has created over US jobs building electric vehicles ; is investing more than double GM + Ford combined [fyi to person controlling this twitter]
Review of Model S by much appreciated
Starting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the kWh version of the Model S ; X. If youd like that version, please order by Sunday night at
Legalize comedy
More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
Tesla does not really have "TTunes". That's a joke.
Great questions from Hack Club!
Prototypes are easy, production is hard
Area of Area
North American Supercharger usage tracking to exceed pre covid highs in to weeks. Lot of noise out there. This is signal.
Battery pack swap is active between SF and LA and seems to be working well. Supercharging is the future, though, for non-commercial traffic.
yes
On Tuesday, SpaceX will attempt to refly both an orbital rocket and spacecraft for the first
Ok
And let's not forget the forum on which we are posting I've heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on Twitter.
Its complicated, but hopefully out next quarter, along with Witcher. Lot of internal debate as to whether we should be putting effort towards generalized gaming emulation vs making individual games work well.
Interesting
True, but achieving a long range affordable electric vehicle has always been our long-term goal. Due in late !
Hamiltonians have +2V the potential of Langrangians and a play!
Already testing traffic lights, stop signs ; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.
Should be very soon. Weve already made around Model Performance cars for test drives in stores.
US Federal Debt/GDP was % in , now it is % ; climbing fast
At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference.
Astronauts preparing to launch to
Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big
High pain threshold
I just had three coffees
They were, but are they currently?
Super messed up situation!
Not easy getting a lightsaber into backpack
This doesnt take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla.
you're right, no point
Resist
A tiny one
Not yet
Haha ok, I will do the Tesla shareholder meeting in a posh British accent
Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe ; later China.
There will definitely be a MarsCoin!
Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.
SN4 passed cryo proof!
Nuke Mars!
If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing ; the tutorial is way too long
We have to solve a huge part of AI just to make cars drive themselves. In retrospect, it was inevitable. The road system is designed for cameras (eyes) ; neural nets (brains).
Good description of the launch by :
Truth
Been wanting to go ever since that Finnish metal band won
Great summary of the key points!
Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software
SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elons
I try so hard with these jokes!
Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? Its what they do.
Probably June
No one suspected his disguise
Design requires at least metric tons of force. Engine reached mT ; bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means % to % more with deep cryo.
When a person dies, the right thing to do is remember the good more than the bad. Not a day for hate (if there is ever such).
We should def make it good to hang out there
Beat the !
A lot has happened in years
To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing.
Third burn successful. Exceeded Mars orbit and kept going to the Asteroid Belt.
Whether commercial or government, monopolies are bad for the people
Yes, will be extremely intense. Early flights are especially dangerous, as theres a lot of new hardware.
Im dying to do super efficient, quiet home HVAC with HEPA ; water distillation. Its weird, but I really want to do it.
Somehow, a hash text file using ancient crypto can be exchanged for real goods ; services!? Amazing.
Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the . It feels like a spaceship.
SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing ; now docking with , which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier, since Starships dock with themselves ; will be uncrewed at first.
Pretty good, how are you?
Election time will be interesting
Super cool
Exactly
Significantly improves control force
Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
His name is Eric, of course
Im driving alpha , but we need to fix some obvious issues before releasing beta , hopefully next week. FSD subscription capability should be turning on via the Tesla app.
Typing Merlin literally just autocorrected me to merkin
Pretty close. Booster ; arms will move faster. QD arm will steady booster for ship mate.
Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
But on the inside
Yay!
Yes
Sure
Maybe worth trying: insert a m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network ; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof ; auto-conform to odd shapes like the cm hole.
Of course!
Our biggest limitation with Fremont is convincing enough associates to build cars when they have so many other job opportunities in the Bay Area! Thanks again Tesla team for doing the hard work of building real products that people love
Hollywood should just start with the sequel ; skip the original, because financials
True, my name literally means tree
History is written by the victors except on Wikipedia haha
Overall master plan should be explained. I think it still makes sense if we dont consider AI b other.
True
Yes
Yup
Starship Hopper will do vertical flight tests similar to the Falcon Hopper
Schatz, bitte hr auf- ich werde rot!
fixing, but in a slightly different way
Full RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event. Ship is fine minor repairs. Exciting day!
Death Valley restored to position of world's hottest place
Done
Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower
Thanks, but weve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.
And increase fun! Hopefully.
Setting up for Model handover tomorrow night ...
Starship will be able to launch telescopes over X diameter of Hubble
Its a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
And those who werent expecting a ternary joke
Pretty much
Sweden is sensible
Thats a great song!
Landing leg frame
True
Falcon Heavy maiden launch this November
Would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while its driving
Tesla Sentry Mode will play Bachs Toccata and Fugue during a robbery (and keep Summer safe)
Might actually be his!
Never heard of it
Starship Mk ; Hopper
Our tiles are mechanically attached
Wow, you think about me a lot!
Starship SN1 tank preparing for Raptor attachment ; static fire
If youre a utility or public utilities commission, please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment ; usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants!
This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
Great interview!
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases.
Getting ready for flight of orbit-class Starship design
Rather than correcting itself, the lower birth rate trend appears to be accelerating
Maybe next month
If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy.
Report highlight: The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost percent after Autosteer installation.
In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.
Were working on it. Agreed, Minecraft is high priority. Roblox too.
Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every months or so (like SpaceX)
Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
Meanwhile, back in reality
Random trivia: my grandfather ; great grandfather were both born in Minnesota. I was named after my GGF.
Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds
philosophically
Wouldnt read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights.
Doesnt matter yet whether you have Tesla FSD computer or Tesla Nvidia-based computer. When it does matter later this year, Tesla will switch the computers for you.
V proud of Tesla team for completing th Model S body. More cars made this month than entire rest of year
Were doing everything we can to get there. Its a super hard grind.
Great song
We can probably just repurpose Model HVAC parts. Not a big deal.
And futuristic diner / drive-in theater planned for Hollywood area!
The Persuader hammer will fix SN1
Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then Im confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity ; lower part count.
Sure
Wanna buy some Bitcoin?
Coming soon
First two domes in frame are for SN2, third is SN1 thrust dome
first solar roof deployments will start next summer
This is more important than it may seem at first
Yeah, but Im English
The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* dont blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
In the end, its all about entropy
Always
Krypton ion thrusters activate in about hours to raise orbit
A nightcap would probably work best
Exactly
Youll live
Yes
Bought some wood and built a little treehouse with my boys. Few more beautiful ways to spend an afternoon.
Meant to say young, but spelled it wrong
Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship.
Accurate. Show that Falcon Heavy addresses all use cases.
Please note Dogecoin has no formal organization ; no one reports to me, so my ability to take action is limited
I do love NASA, always have
Amazingly, this is not an Onion article
Buying took over a decade, $11M ; amazing amount of effort. Didnt like even when we were only making .
Hey babe, fancy a hot date ?
Were focusing on Boca right now for Starship ; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
Exactly
Progress is accelerating
Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over X the image processing ability.
What should Tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world?
We are a pattern of ancient atoms
No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes
Reality is hard
We are tiny, simple creatures
Thanks for hosting me in Tulsa today!
Um I ate most of it
Probably a good one to design ; engineer in Germany
That would be cool
yes
Worth reading Human Compatible by Stuart Russell (hes great!) about future AI risks ; solutions
Shoulda seen it coming
Neuralink wont overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input ; output, especially latter.
Agreed
Ok
It wont need to reach visa speed, as regulated exchanges will act as de facto second layer. But the perfect should not be the enemy of the good it is still good to increase base layer transaction speed ; lower base layer transaction cost.
Its remarkable how often The News attempts to answer the question: what is the worst thing that happened on Earth today?
Yes
Yes
Doesnt seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given bar max demonstrated chamber pressure.
National Science Foundation, u should add a W to ur name. Would get way more clicks. Ur welcome.
Why arent more people talking about this!?
His name is Eric, of course
RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly
Btw, you can buy a Tesla online in less than mins ; give it back for a full refund for any reason
Amazing series of space pics assembled by
Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didnt affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission.
Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables /7 electricity security for your home. Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full ; can stabilize grid.
To be clear, a Hyperloop passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect (just for testing), nor uncomfortable acceleration
was this in a test drive car (those are all about to be upgraded) or a current customer car?
propellant grade kerosene (basically, jet fuel) ; liquid oxygen are close, but H2 ; O2 are not
Yeah, we just finished two more propellant domes. SpaceX team ; supporting suppliers are doing amazing work ramping Starship production.
Isnt it obvious?
Reality is its own parrot parody
Tesla customers are v smart ; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: % want it disabled -- not %, %.
A cool thing about the design is thats easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
Doge is underestimated
Ive never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived ; gave people back their jobs. They havent forgotten UAW betrayed them. Thats why UAW cant even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.
Blade Runner Esper Edition Vangelis
Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity ; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach .
Fun, exciting tweets coming soon!
Congrats SpaceX Falcon team!
Yes
Improvements in :

Hopefully, early next week
Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone
Every th buyer of our boringly boring hat will get a free hat signed by the delivery guy
The ratio of machine to human compute skyrockets
Stage Zero, which is everything needed to launch ; catch the rocket, is at least as hard as the booster or ship
In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council ; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong.
Latest science predicts &gt; trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens

You can also talk through the car speaker. Great for practical jokes
Yahoo Finance is as dumb as it sounds
China ; Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind.
Saw a play about Stalin in Norwegian. Like watching mimes with emoticons doing Solzhenitsyn.
Anyone who bought FSD will get it
In a way, this is free QA haha
That is true ; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
Good analysis. Both computers will be used ; sync ~20 times per second. This is a long time to a computer. Like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one.
Doffs
We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
Just want to say thanks to customers ; investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you.
Were going to use the pedestrian pink noise speaker to talk to people ; create customized horn sounds. I beg your pardon, but would you be so kind as to allow me to proceed? Said in the voice of Mr. Darcy.
Pretty much
Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us.
A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI ; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is whats truly hard). Dont care if you even graduated high school.
Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. Im in awe.
Haha
Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but thats more of a long-term solution.
Absolutely!

Saw The Lego Movie earlier today. Brilliant writing and humor! Loved the "Everything is awesome..." theme song.
Starlink terminal has motors to self-orient for optimal view angle. No expert installer required. Just plug in ; give it a clear view of the sky. Can be in garden, on roof, table, pretty much anywhere, so long as it has a wide view of the sky.

I guess a proof of concept is needed
Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
Congrats Mom! I love you.

Yup
Ship leeward side will be bare metal, windward will have black, hexagonal heat shield tiles
Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans ; has severe drawbacks.
Happy Mothers Day. I love you Mom!
First production cars will be handed over on Sept at our Fremont factory
About mins from static fire
Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing thats problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
Not from us, but it's awesome
Ray tracing on Cyberpunk with HDR is next-level. Have you tried it?
Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country.

How about a wifi camera link?
Passive lateral safety is required by regulators ; I think theyre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.
Not yet
Lovable dog . Mine looks like yours but in black ; white.
You drive a hard bargain, but ok
The was not to outcompete other companies, but rather to maximize usefulness ; rate of progress in the absolute
Background on the launch
Yeah. Active fairing half recovered though.
Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only miles long. Very high accel/decel needed
To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub ; charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day blacklights, luminescent spray paint ; metal junk sculptures.
But Taycan does seem like a good car. Nrburgring track time is great.
No, but I do have a Gundam Wing
Tonnage to orbit is the more fundamental metric
If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I cant figure them out.
Tbh, we are just a bit less foolish than before

True
They have an important role to play in protecting the public from getting swindled, but are sometimes too close to Wall St hedge funds imo. Strange that they arent taking more action on some of the SPACs.
Exactly
Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard
Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
Yes, updated UI coming with FSD wide release. All cars with FSD computer will have new mind of car view. All /Y can be upgraded to have FSD computer.

Agreed, thats the right future
Were switching to a more sensible FSD version numbering to distinguish between major ; minor updates. Current build is FSD . It drove me to an unfamiliar location in LA ; back last night with no interventions!

All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox ; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness ; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms
Raptor has now run for secs at bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. R-Boost variant is aiming for ton thrust at bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.
If advanced AI (beyond basic bots) hasnt been applied to manipulate social media, it wont be long before it is
Interesting ideas
Sorry
Dragon was originally designed to land with thrusters, but its not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings
Bioshock is amazing
Falcon/Dragon launch punted to early Jan. Need time to review all systems thoroughly again.
There are also many state ; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities ; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc
Tom is great ; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin ; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups ; restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device.

Vision became so good that radar actually reduced SNR, so radar was turned off. Humans drive with eyes ; biological neural nets, so makes sense that cameras ; silicon neural nets are only way to achieve generalized solution to self-driving.
Whats cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord
Service center expansion is at max speed, so yes

Beta V8.3 has literally ~1000 improvements. Will take time to QA internally before release probably in two or three weeks.
Youre most welcome! Glad to be helpful.
Autopilot doesnt need the guide wheels. Theyre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
It was a mistake to try to use the Elise. In the end, only ~5% of the Elise parts ended up being used. Tesla Roadster is a totally different car.

Hard to beat the Great Pyramid!
Not that Im aware of
SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary full ; rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth. Starlinks purpose is to provide Internet to the least served ; to pay for Mars.
SpaceX propulsion just achieved first firing of the Raptor interplanetary transport engine
Am for good public transit in LA, but the pace of that construction makes the look fast.
Saints Row
Soon
LA has a subway, but most people dont know about it
To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car
Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks ; relight would be a major win.
Great team
Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon ; Dragon, although theyre critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term.
Hoping to open in Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia ; most of Eastern Europe early next year. Finally, we will do Nikola Tesla proud by having his cars in his countries of origin!

Sorry, weve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint ; quality in general. If need be, were repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done.
Interesting
Now give people back their FREEDOM
The rumor that Im secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
FSD predicts height from video pixels directly, without needing to classify groups of pixels into objects. In principle, even if a UFO crashed on the road right in front of you, it would still avoid the debris. Some work still needed to tune sensitivity.
Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation.

Going through final validation ; regulatory approval. Probably releases to early access program owners in a few weeks. Its trippy!
Pretty much
Cool
But actually
Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours.
Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) ; more ground stations are deployed. As were able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
Exactly. Yeah.
To be clear, I do support vaccines in general ; covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal. In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen.

Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries ; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?
Yes
Thank you on behalf of SpaceX! We have always admired your rocket/spacecraft technology.

Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.
Its a great whistle!
Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship
Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate.
Giga Berlin / GF4 will absolutely be designed with sustainability and the environment in mind
Theres so much power going through this engine that its close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places

Ok sure Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldnt be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.

Congrats Tesla Team on over car built ; delivered in Q2, despite many challenges!!
The long-term strength of Tesla will be manufacturing technology
So amazing that we decompress from a single cell to over trillion cells
I mean just the image
This thing we call money is just a (slow, lossy ; unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people, at least until AGI happens, which will obviate need for labor ; necessitate UBI.
SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking ; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly

Does the psych ward know you smuggled in a mobile phone?
Yes
Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called Low Gear!
More like to mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is *v*sin /2, as I recall, but doesnt matter, as theres no geo anywhere near that mass.
I hate advertising
Thanks, hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent.
True!
Radiation
Sure
This is a misperception. SpaceX developed ; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with . Just pointless imo for self-driving. If youre going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm.
Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling ; driving feel. Extremely important metric.
Just iMessage ; Signal
At Tesla Giga Shanghai NSFW!!
That would be great
agreed
Fremont shut down for two days (parts shortages) ; restarted yesterday
Scammers ; crypto should get a room
F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production ; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
Sorry to hear that. Will fix.
Improved Accommodations
Falcon on launch pad with Crew Dragon ; new astronaut walkway
Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as ventilator, but makes many good points
SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.

There is a big difference between reaching space and reaching orbit
Because it costs $2500 to transport to east coast ; everyone pays same
Exactly! Weve only one car factory in California ; one Gigafactory (for batteries ; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries ; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs ; improve logistics worldwide.
Yeah, theyre all good, but I particularly liked his biography of Ben Franklin
Amazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe ; China! Most insane logistics challenge Ive ever seen. Thanks also to many country ; city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated.

Iain certainly wasnt pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldnt be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through ; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but thats a special case.
To Tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year, your support is super appreciated!!
Ok, well throw that in too
Short shorts coming soon to Tesla merch
No guarantees, but maybe next month. Requires quite a lot of incremental testing ; code tweaks for different road system in Canada.

If you leave hydrogen out in the sun long enough, it starts talking to itself
I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!
Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so its going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience.

Thanks
Tesla Model S loses % after k miles, a Mercedes S-Class will lose %, a BMW -series will lose %, and an Audi A8 will lose %.
Well, tbh, our capex efficiency in was trash
What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla.

Probably no fairing either ; just Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, tons empty) with Isp of . Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR . Spread out, see whats there. Not impossible.

This is completely backwards. Based on what weve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, were moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Wont need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.
Good thread
Essentially. Long-term purpose of my Tesla stock is to help make life multiplanetary to ensure its continuance. The massive capital needs are in to years. By then, if were fortunate, Teslas goal of accelerating sustainable energy ; autonomy will be mostly accomplished.

RWD is slightly more efficient, but dual motor AWD is faster ; more agile
Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez
Dont know yet, but its important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so well make costs as low as possible
Yes
Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. Consumers are starting to realize this.

Exactly
It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
Tesla Model S ; X Plaid are so fun!
I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM ; Chrysler were going bankrupt.
It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail
Exactly. Also, you cant actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds.
That would be cool

Yeah
This isnt quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision thats X to X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures ; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.
To those who quietly help advance the causes we mutually believe in, knowing advancing the cause is the only reward: thank you
Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes, buying single use airplanes wd seem crazy.

Failure rate is actually both higher ; lower than that, as the Falcon design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.

Good point
Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump ; lines.

To be clear, this doesnt affect Tesla website order prices. Existing inventory prices are currently slightly lower than on website. This will bring them in line.
Lucky bastards, we are!

Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal.
This may sound crazy, but asking real people what theyd like in a product is a great way to meet their needs

But % of statistics are false
Strange, if true. - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory. - A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?

Heres one:
Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; . Target is ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.

Very much a beta calculation. It will evolve over time to more accurately predict crash probability.
Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise ; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.
Very strange. Model is designed to have super good stopping distance ; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out ; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.
Its a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.

Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
But actually nothing. Was surprised to hear theyre across the road. Adding silicon to carbon anode makes sense. We already do. Question is just what ratio of silicon to carbon ; what shape? Silicon expands like crazy during discharge ; comes apart, so cycle life is usually bad.

Are you the same today as you were yesterday?
However, we wont customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla ; customer legal bill to be high ; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
No need to wait. Its super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
million pounds of thrust at liftoff
Not risky imo ; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar systems fusion reactor (the sun).

This will be really important one day. Much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on Earth, but there were far more that merely destroyed a continent. Comets (not asteroids) are the real wild card, as were only able to track ~4600 out of ~1 trillion.
Damn haters
FCC is fair ; sensible. NHTSA ; FAA too. % of the time, I agree with regulators! On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didnt anticipate.

Probably late July
I agree
Useful mass to orbit is what matters
The joints will have shielding, but its hard to ensure a good seal. Transpiration cooling (or simply higher pressure cold gas flow) would purge the area behind the hot gas seal.
Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
Activate autopilot X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon.
Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from kW to +kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of best case ; more than for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.

If Reich actually cares about global warming, why is he making so much hot air!?
As a robotaxi, probably closer to hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost ; larger range pack needed.

Listening to Revolutions by Duncan Found this on a throw pillow
We should be laughing our asses off if its so damn smart!
We def could be wrong about this, but its actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place ; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Dont need a lot of room ; moment of inertia is much lower.
That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon

(Formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative ; political bias about almost everything. Reading major newspapers makes you feel sad ; angry. Thats why theyre being crushed by . Likes/retweets of old media are extremely low. Ironic article:
Those dang budgie smugglers!!
Roughly % of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a % too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus.
Reminder that Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) price goes up by $1k on July st
Why does ur pp look like u just came?
Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description, but yes
I think we can improve that with a little software optimization

Video review of Model S vs. Aston Martin Rapide S by
Some exciting news this week: Tesla Version software with Autopilot goes to wide release on Thursday!
Good assessment of the Dark Knight Rises in the Atlantic. Dickens, not Rand.
He talks like an NPC with a limited dialogue tree
True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months ; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.
Sandwich time travel is the only explanation
Might actually happen
Incoming rocket ; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon
Nicheman his superpower is appealing to small audiences
Rawlinson didnt design Model S. Prototype was done before he joined ; he left us in the lurch just as things got tough, which was not cool. He did make some contributions to body/chassis engineering, but not to powertrain, battery, electronics or software.
Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them.
Ideally, Doge speeds up block time X, increases block size X ; drops fee X. Then it wins hands down.
Cool haha
Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic
Yeah, goal is to reflect reality, so screen render will become increasingly so
That is the acid test
Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla ; get any image they want laser etched in glass ; sent to deep space for millions of years
It certainly needs to be better ; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives ; reduces injuries should be released.
Time to stop projecting ; cool off
Good idea
Would love to, but import duties are extremely high, even for electric vehicles
No, original forward facing seats plus rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.
Custom ultra high speed bus ; efficient cooling
Any user input counts
Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors ; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with
That is just one part of the surgery. For this to scale, it must be fully automated, like LASIK.
Probability that were in base Polytopia is highly unlikely - KWM
Sorry!

One person at Tesla (out of ) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife ; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was.
Wow

A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
For an in-depth explanation, read
True
Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.
There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off of the bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.
Exactly
Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
No
Actually, we still operate our California factory, which is the largest auto plant in North America, at full capacity and are considering expanding it significantly. It has built /3 of all electric vehicles in North America, twice as much as all other carmakers combined.
Stop, youre making me blush
Given so many other companies are depending on this mission, it is getting even more scrutiny than a Starlink flight

Solar glass tiles can also incorporate heating elements, like rear defroster on a car, to clear roof of snow and keep generating energy
Love Just Water btw
Model reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March and online April
Thats about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot ; have to be replaced.
If you are curious about the P85D, you can schedule a test drive here:
Also, we will have a very high headcount around each Gigafactory keeping it running. They just won't be doing boring, repetitive tasks.
Haha awesome
Theyve been writing bogus articles about Tesla (and me) for years. In the end, it is their own credibility that suffers.
Were working on moving more cars to Florida. End of year delivery is intense! Very proud of Tesla team for all their hard work.
Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form
Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary.

Recruiting ace engineers for Giga Berlin! Will interview in person tomorrow on site. Send resume to Guns.com.
Thanks for tuning in to the Model unveil Part ! Part is super next level, but that's for later
The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what Im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.
Was gonna say well do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun
Coming soon!
Your company said the exact opposite in when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. In any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter.
Exactly
Going with nomenclature of Giga [most widely understood location name] vs Giga , so Giga Shanghai, Giga Nevada, Giga New York ; Giga Berlin
If the government had the mandate of the people, there would be a significant counter-protest. There is not, therefore they do not.

Dont know
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle ; practical limits of simultaneity in transfer make this exact thought experiment impossible, but yeah
So good!
A few other small things change, but pretty close
I didnt think so at the time
Car won't complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically, so camera more robust to pitch angle.
Yeah

Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front ; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power ; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination ; dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Night at the museum. G has mad skillzsz. Me not so much.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
I made the volume on the Model S go to . Now I just need to work in a miniature Stonehenge...
The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about ; how prominently theyre placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative.
Thanks ! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was km, Falcon achieved km.
for sure!
Cybertruck doesnt look like anything Ive seen bouncing around the Internet. Its closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.

SpaceX reprioritized to cyber defense ; overcoming signal jamming. Will cause slight delays in Starship ; Starlink V2.
Ok
Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone.
Still aiming for booster ; Ship for first orbital test flight (this is pure coincidence!)
Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) ; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year.
Please consider joining Tesla AI software or hardware teams!
Homes on Jupiter with solar-power *and* a Powerwall going right now for great price!
Knight Rider is real
True, cost of operating a Tesla is much lower than other cars
Nice
Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of % seems about right. Below % is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced ; above % too negatively affects economic output.
Meant to say annualized production rate at end of probably around k, ie k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about k.
Looking forward to international expansion later this year
Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1.
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
Starship design goal is flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every ships yield megaton per year to orbit
Switching to renewables with batteries would avoid blackouts. Batteries are essential, due to the intermittent nature of renewables.
Some progress
Maybe didn't realize he turned it off, but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument cluster.

Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally secs if you use Apple Pay at .
No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous ; difficult than Earth ; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. Thats the sales pitch. Want to go?
As the planets align only once every two years
Will do some press Q;A on Autopilot post at am PDT tmrw and then publish at noon. Sorry about delay. Unusually difficult couple of weeks.
Time flies
Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New confirmed cases, not oft-reported presumptive positive is trending to level off over next few weeks ; be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China.
Special light pattern (but not hazards, as theyre too shrill) seems right
Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching times lower chance of accident than average vehicle
We might be in one right now
Sure, we can probably do an update later this year
We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Cant wipe it off.
Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.

Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled X stainless is much stronger.
Between the trees and the forest floor, its like a giant mural, continued the veritable High Priest of the Harvest Season, adding that he would soon have to rake his driveway, an activity for which he will most certainly don a cashmere scarf.
Well aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We wont do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck ; almost died on one when I was .
Others will probably pass human trials first, but this machine is pretty special for generalized vaccine production. Was originally intended for rabies, which is a very tricky virus.
Yes
I put the art in fart
Yeah, system should adapt to most likely destination ; anticipate school, then work, if thats owner preference
Got to bar before RUD, but cause may be due to oxygen inlet pressure too low, rather than engine issues
Will do another rev before final design

Billy G is not my lover
Only a matter of time before advanced AI is used to do this. Internet is particularly susceptible to a gradient descent algo.
Honestly, I would let the border regions vote. Let the people there actually decide.
True
Do you think the US ; China should have equal ; fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints ; other factors.
Water ice on Mars
True
Probably Starlink ; some fun things
At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly global regions, due to planning mistakes ; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
Tesla needs to iterate fast on solar roof prefab/install technology, so all installs will be done by Tesla techs at first
Starship Concerto in Zero G
That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation.

Paperwork ; hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla
I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp
Exactly. And many areas of countries showing good Internet actually have poor or no access, so those are important to address too.
The Tesla Supercharger will over time allow you to travel anywhere on pure sunlight for free
Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best.
As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year.

Usually, they dont even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so.
My best guess for : ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in
Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below cycles ; cycles is their max.

Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car -2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldnt exist or would have started much later.
Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EVs have high fire risk when opposite is true.
For sure on first crewed missions for exactly that reason
Bravo, right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal.
Tesla is steadily moving all NNs to camera surround video. This will enable superhuman self-driving.
Good idea
I guess you could say its a mph, underground, autonomous, electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. So, yes, a bus.
Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!
No, its got enough load capacity ; volume to carry the battery pack ; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about % to % of effort, all things considered.
It might be
Tim is great
This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July . We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July (even if you dont have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?

The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow ; complex, varying considerably by state. Tesla is hoping to offer real-time (based on actual driving history) insurance in Texas next month. Probably next year before we get approval in New York.
Youre welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
Jets are so cool
Exactly
Agreed
It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Theres some great AI out there, but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk ?
