8,There,There are probably some good third party mod shops out there but I think you will find them less helpful &amp; less helpful. Merchants of Doubt
9,Good,"Good game! Not saying flamethrowers are perfect, but they certainly have the potential to be great. Also, yes, we will provide"
10,Thanks,Thanks! Will definitely be a fun project for Tesla software &amp; hardware. Will include easy import/export of music &amp; play functions.
11,Bitcoin,Bitcoin is a unit of exchange between miners &amp; hashing power of majority of Earths population (primarily iron &amp; coal). Every transaction
12,Ascent,"Ascent phase easy, circle too slow, rocket roll out slightly slow &amp; center stage caught out fast by the control tower. At this point"
13,Yeah,"Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in"
14,Major,Major feature requests! Were working on that now. Major feature request with huge fanfare. Thanks for your support over the years. We really appreciate it
15,Tomorrow,Tomorrow's SpaceX presentation is at pm Texas time. Spacecraft presentation is at pm Florida time. Presentation not. Limiting factor is attendance. If
16,Landing,"Landing leg frame on booster, catching air with legs. Landing leg frame on Super Heavy Booster. Boostback deployable for sure. Physics is hard"
17,Indeed,"Indeed, this is an important point. In general with new technology, any criticism of existing companies must be objectively grounded. My point being that patents *"
18,Maybe,"Maybe there are already satellites in orbit! Will check. Maybe helpful with helo. We can launch one day, maybe two. Maybe some helpful with"
