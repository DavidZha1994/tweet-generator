0,Entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves
1,Just meeting with Larry Ellison to seek some advice. Back working on Tesla end of quarter tomorrow.
2,Absolutely
3,What should Tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world?
4,Absolutely
5,Taste of the future
6,Try playing Polytopia in your Tesla! Great game. Multiplayer online version coming soon.
7,"Focus on making products &amp; services people truly love, so that the total economic pie is bigger, instead of engaging in zero-sum/negative-sum corporate power struggles. This is the good future."
8,"Roughly % of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a % too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus."
9,Yes
10,Very important
11,"Ok, service might be able to do this. Will check."
12,You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that dont have it?
13,"No, but definitely this year"
14,Good point
15,Interesting
16,Liz has always done great interviews
17,"Falcon was % of successful orbital launches in , but maybe a majority of payload to orbit. Anyone done the math?"
18,Vaccines are just the start. Its also capable in theory of curing almost anything. Turns medicine into a software &amp; simulation problem.
19,Yes
20,We will offer multiple display options
21,A few more revisions needed. Probably Beta or .
22,Sure
23,Haha ok
24,"There are subtle, important, differences between US &amp; Canada traffic rules, but FSD beta will be extended to Canada very soon"
25,Yes
26,We need a match other traffic speed setting
27,Definitely
28,Its a step in that direction
29,"Its one or /2 if you dont have a car with pedestrian speaker. We couldnt get everything done in time, but more stuff coming."
30,The writing on Cobra Kai is sick
31,Haha I will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts
32,You can upload custom music/sounds
33,"Unfortunately, pedestrian speaker is needed, otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn"
34,"Change your horn sound to , , or holiday jingles with latest Tesla software update!"
35,Merry Christmas &amp; happy holidays!
36,Great game!
37,It will most likely make sense for Starlink to go public once the revenue growth is reasonably predictable
38,"Engineering, design &amp; general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind &amp; are the fundamental limitation on doing more. Capital allocation is important, but low CPU load. Tesla public company duties are a much bigger factor, but going private is impossible now (sigh)."
39,Yes
40,A few months
41,Coming soon
42,Minor
43,Yeah
44,story rocket turns off its engines &amp; does a controlled fall
45,"Yup, were just ironing out a few bugs"
46,"To Tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year, your support is super appreciated!!"
47,Frictionless AI. What could possibly go wrong?
48,Good idea
49,"During the darkest days of the Model program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for /10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting."
50,"Strange, if true. - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory. - A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?"
51,Spartas reply to Macedon
52,Hi Liz!
53,Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make Tesla successful. My heart goes out to you.
54,Indeed
55,"It was a seriously twisted affair, but alls that ends well."
56,"They are, although its kind low-key. Tesla Superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars."
57,Are such large transactions even possible?
58,i love all u crazy ppl out there
59,You have a point (sigh)
60,Great game
61,"Pretty much. The main value of college used to be hanging out, having pseudo intellectual conversations &amp; partying with people your own age. Now, even thats gone."
62,"Come for the comments, stay for the memes"
63,Absolutely. We will release FSD subscription early next year.
64,One word: Doge
65,Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money
66,Great nails &amp; lipstick
67,Nice
68,Sounds about right
69,Lord Edge
70,Nice branding
71,"Just kidding, who needs a safe word anyway!?"
72,Bitcoin is my safe word
73,Standing down for today to inspect rocket. Hopefully launching tomorrow.
74,Pressure is slightly high in upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Review underway.
75,I am hoping to be back next month!
76,Very impressive mission by China!
77,Last launch of coming up
78,"He was indeed quite grumpy, but we did not actually know what we were doing, so he had a point"
79,"It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Theres some great AI out there, but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk ?"
80,"Star Light, Star Bright"
81,This is incorrect
82,But it is visually stunning &amp; playability is good
83,"A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesnt make sense in the absence of magic. Also, wish there werent level-based item limits in a single-player game."
84,Oh and umm
85,"I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare"
86,"The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off."
87,"Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines"
88,"Its a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great"
89,"Perhaps slightly more confident, but its essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic."
90,Dankeschn Brandenburg und Grnheide!
91,Sure hope that future doesnt come to pass!
92,"Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, (worlds most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict."
93,"Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great"
94,The objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. This is a much more serious issue:
95,Ascent to the Heavens
96,"Yeah, briefly. Seems pretty good. I picked Nomad, so start was a little slow, but picks up fast. Seemed like almost everyone on Steam was playing Cyberpunk at some point this weekend!"
97,Hehe
98,init void
99,*cooling haha
100,"I still have a soft spot in my heart for transpiration cooking. In theory, it would use more mass than a tile heatshield, but that remains to be seen."
101,"Ship leeward side will be bare metal, windward will have black, hexagonal heat shield tiles"
102,Yes
103,"Agreed, should be preserved in memory of SN8"
104,Exactly! Woohoo!!
105,"SN8 did great! Even reaching apogee wouldve been great, so controlling all way to putting the crater in the right spot was epic!!"
106,"Thank you, South Texas for your support! This is the gateway to Mars."
107,"Life, the Universe and Everything"
108,"Yeah, engines did great!"
109,"Mars, here we come!!"
110,"Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high &amp; RUD, but we got all the data we needed! Congrats SpaceX team hell yeah!!"
111,"Successful ascent, switchover to header tanks &amp; precise flap control to landing point!"
112,Near-orbital space is the fastest way to travel long distance on Earth!
113,"Its called the Space Station, but its actually moving around Earth at ~25 times the speed of sound or ~10 times faster than a rifle bullet"
114,"So long, and thanks for the orifice! - Alien message decrypted"
115,Probably /3 chance of completing all mission objectives
116,Hopefully flying tomorrow
117,Yup
118,Out on the pad in South Texas
119,"Wow, Station looks amazing!"
120,"Knock, knock, singing telegram!"
121,Carrying even more symbiotic bacteria (~40 trillion) than cells
122,Yes
123,We are mobile cell colonies
124,Im Gesprch mit Mathias Dpfner
125,Congratulations!
126,Congratulations!
127,"Yes, it does."
128,And no toilet paper
129,Watch Demolition Man
130,Prometheus Unbound
131,Not bad
132,It was a beast compared to the VIC-20
133,"Award accepted on behalf of the great people at Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink &amp; Boring Co"
134,"Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a rocket scientist, only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon."
135,"Science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the Universe, engineering is about creating things that never existed"
136,It does get a bit cold at night
137,Paint makes a hell of a difference
138,Congrats!
139,Thanks for everything you did to help build SpaceX! Some of the best memories ever.
140,It will be real soon
141,"Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs."
142,"Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights"
143,Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.
144,It will have landing legs
145,"Yes, very sad news. Tony was great."
146,"For a second there, I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha"
147,"Yeah, truncate zeros &amp; then round"
148,Probably going to a wider beta in ~2 weeks
149,fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what were betting on for training with Dojo
150,Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great
151,But actually!
152,Happy Thanksgiving!
153,Hopefully next month
154,"Ok. Overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically."
155,Haha true
156,The Promise is greatly needed
157,"We will have special colors for new Roadster, as we did for the original"
158,. is savage
159,If you ever wondered where we came from
160,"This is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal"
161,"Yes, but only slightly filled"
162,This is a subject of much debate
163,Major upgrades are slated for SN15
164,"Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc."
165,But thats why we have SN &amp; SN10
166,"Lot of things need to go right, so maybe /3 chance"
167,"Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip."
168,Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
169,Not yet
170,"Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but its probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull."
171,"Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary"
172,Yes
173,"Were still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference."
174,FSD Beta coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.
175,Exciting mission!
176,Wow
177,Yea
178,"Tomorrow will be the th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You"
179,Sure
180,True
181,We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point.
182,"Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy"
183,Yes
184,Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over years ago. Might have been tempting fate!
185,Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products
186,Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.
187,Landing at Vandenberg AFB in California
188,"Actually, off to the side (so it doesnt take out the launch mount in bad landing), but with the same arm used to pick up the ship"
189,Where it should be!
190,"Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise itd be wrong to ask others to do so."
191,"Well, almost anything"
192,Quite the day ahead
193,Now *this* is what youd call pointy!
194,Cool
195,"Theyre moving at ~25 times the speed of sound, but it feels like nothing"
196,There will always be upgrades
197,It will be better than human vision by quite a margin
198,Reality looks like a strange ghost-world at radar wavelengths. Almost everything except metal is translucent.
199,Exactly
200,"This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with . Just pointless imo for self-driving. If youre going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm."
201,One day we will fly you on Starship
202,Well done!
203,"I cant comment on turbopump internal details, but youre roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist."
204,"To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this."
205,"Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej."
206,Yeah. They stole Apples code too.
207,They have an old version of our software &amp; dont have our NN inference computer
208,Wild times!
209,Congrats!
210,Yup
211,"Change out a few parts, otherwise fine"
212,Caution strongly advised with SPACs
213,Sure
214,Haha sexy cropping champion of all time
215,"If next weeks release looks good, we will widen beta"
216,"Unfortunately, there are too many rules around liquor distribution, even in the US. However, we will be selling the lightning bottle &amp; shot glasses worldwide."
217,"Next weeks release is special. Lot of fundamental improvements, both important bug fixes &amp; entire new areas of functionality."
218,years &amp; $11 billion wow
219,Safety is our primary design goal
220,Fully
221,Let the Martians decide their own future
222,A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units!
223,"Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. However, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization discovering our ruins will be impressed humans got that far."
224,That is certainly the intention!
225,The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla
226,"Wise words from Bogle. The point of companies is products &amp; services. They have no point in &amp; of themselves, nor do these indices. Buy &amp; hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap, sell where you dont."
227,"No, just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per mL."
228,"Life in glass domes at first. Eventually, terraformed to support life, like Earth."
229,Yeah
230,"I was going to say Sim!, but that seemed too obvious haha"
231,Deveras!
232,"And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. Second test determines whether theyre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious."
233,So many things you want &amp; some you didnt know you wanted
234,Maybe a little Mercy
235,Tesla holiday software release is
236,Cobra Kai is a deep cut
237,Its all cake &amp; someone took a bite
238,There is such a thing as too much sentience
239,Deus ex machine learning
240,"Its designed to make life multiplanetary, otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity! Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than times all current Earth rockets combined, including Falcon. Necessary, for a city on Mars."
241,More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London.
242,Nullius in Verba
243,Indeed
244,Dojo/Doge
245,"Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than tons to orbit, so its mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year"
246,Exactly
247,"Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen."
248,"Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!"
249,"Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesnt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold."
250,Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.
251,"Pretty close. Definitely feel if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences Ive ever had."
252,Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad
253,"About secs after starting engines, martyte covering concrete below shattered, sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. One rock blade severed avionics cable, causing bad shutdown of Raptor."
254,The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* dont blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
255,We should just count the atoms at this point
256,"Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over % of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over % of the problem. That % inspiration is very important, but its less than % of the pain."
257,Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didnt work at all. years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.
258,Maybe *I* just love irony haha
259,"Theyre on their way! Hopefully, more Teslaquila next month."
260,Special permission received from Stonecutters Guild!
261,Fate Irony
262,Well said.
263,"Damn, thats not easy! I spent quite a bit of time looking at Russian/Ukrainian engines. Theyre good."
264,Yes
265,Toss a bitcoin to ur Witcher
266,"CureVac, Moderna &amp; a few others. Tesla makes the machine CureVac uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of lipid-coated mRNA strands."
267,Creating synthetic mRNA for cures/vaccines is the future of medicine imo. Turns it (mostly) into a software &amp; modeling problem.
268,Haha
269,Great thread
270,"Im ok, thanks for asking. No symptoms for past few days, apart from fatigue. Unless something changes, would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold."
271,Launch in minutes
272,"Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls"
273,"The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other"
274,"Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety"
275,"Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety"
276,Ok
277,"Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold. Ive had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over."
278,"Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this."
279,"Both obv insanely great, too bad they had this pointless argument"
280,Astronaut launch today!
281,No kids though
282,Hell of a wig collection too
283,It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results
284,Worth reading this thread if youre curious about rona testing
285,"They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if its high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes positive."
286,"A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks."
287,"In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If Im asking the wrong question, what is a better question?"
288,"Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged."
289,Just a scratch. We can buff it out.
290,"Am getting wildly different results from different labs, but most likely I have a moderate case of covid. My symptoms are that of a minor cold, which is no surprise, since a coronavirus is a type of cold."
291,NPCs all the way up
292,Ahem
293,Unless youre on DMT
294,Laws of thermodynamics: . You cant win . You cant break even . You cant stop playing
295,Shakes fist at entropy
296,Big expansion of beta program in to weeks!
297,"Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle &amp; N3 (generic sars) at . I get results of todays test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results."
298,Whats honey?
299,Feels that way
300,This seems accurate
301,Cold symptoms are gone for now
302,There are degrees of pos
303,Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford . General public doesnt realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.
304,"The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, youre probably not infectious above &amp; you probably are below . Sound about right?"
305,This a great reference! Worth a read.
306,Case closed
307,Soon
308,"Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below is accurate, to gets dicey &amp; above is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere."
309,Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below cycles is reliable &amp; above cycles is not
310,"Note, this is not the spike protein. They dont consider that reliable."
311,"Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below cycles &amp; cycles is their max."
312,Strange
313,"Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu."
314,"Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low."
315,From
316,Sure is
317,"Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. Whats the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?"
318,Interesting
319,Interesting
320,What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
321,"A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer. False positives will roughly scale with of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic:"
322,"Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil."
323,"Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid is an equally correct title. The rapid antigen test from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin."
324,The carousel turns ever faster
325,Yup
326,Exactly
327,Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
328,"If its happening to me, its happening to others. Im getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about hours."
329,"Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD."
330,"Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. Well have to swap out at least one of the engines."
331,Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
332,"We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise its going to pop the cork."
333,Astronauts fly to on Sat night from Cape. First operational flight of Crew Dragon.
334,Luck is the best superpower
335,Yes
336,It is an honor that they would choose to work with me. I strive to ensure that the companies enable creative &amp; driven people to reach their potential.
337,Such a privilege to work with people I like &amp; respect so much. I feel blessed.
338,Probably
339,Happy to see this
340,"I do expect this to become an important product for the world, but probably not financially material for Tesla"
341,Theres no entry/braking burn &amp; hypersonic angle of attack is ~70 degrees
342,Tesla makes the RNA Bioreactor that can make vaccines / cures. CureVac has version in use. Version is under development.
343,Checking
344,I just hope this game doesnt twist itself to tedium out of fear of being canceled
345,"Yes, you can have my damn cookie! should be a browser setting"
346,Thanks to a lot of great Autopilot/AI hardware &amp; software engineers at Tesla!
347,For sure
348,Will be worth it
349,Exactly
350,Sure
351,"Actually, its still there"
352,Wait until you see what Cybertruck will do
353,This is accidental. Will be back shortly.
354,Am hoping to change booster design to land back on launch mount with no legs. Will require extreme precision.
355,Chip has temp sensor &amp; automatically maintains safe temp
356,Enough already on my plate &amp; Teslas. Maybe one day will do a prototype. Those are relatively easy. Volume production with high reliability &amp; low cost &amp; passing all regulations is X harder.
357,"Neuralink wont overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input &amp; output, especially latter."
358,"We rewrote all labeling software for D. Very different from labeling single photos. Dojo wont contribute for about a year. Its mostly a generalized NN training computer, but benchmark were tracking is frames/second. Must beat next gen GPU/TPU clusters or its pointless."
359,Version is about a year away
360,It would appear that their calculations were incorrect
361,China understands the profound importance of reusability. The era of expendable rockets will soon be over.
362,Tesla Autopilot/AI team
363,"Good explanation. D is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle &amp; pedestrian traffic. Frame rate &amp; latency from frame to wheel vector change also important."
364,The Phantom of the Opera Is here inside your mind
365,Just looking for problem-solvers who get things done with a high sense of urgency. Dont care if or where they went to school.
366,"When sending your resume, please describe a few of the hardest problems you solved &amp; exactly how you solved them"
367,A New Banner is needed Neither hard left nor right
368,Another fine day in the simulation
369,"Faraday invented the electric motor, Tesla the (commutator-free, three-phase) AC induction motor, in other words, a useful electric motor"
370,"Maxwell was amazing. Should have more recognition. Tesla Motors, Inc., was almost called Faraday, as it took until late /2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since ."
371,is ten times better than
372,Awaiting approval from Canadian authorities
373,Recruiting ace engineers for Giga Berlin! Will interview in person tomorrow on site. Send resume to Guns.com.
374,Stop being a chad
375,Uh Chad wtf
376,"Einstein was great, but did not succeed at engineering (and he tried)"
377,"Yeah, that will be relatively easy, as so few users out in the ocean"
378,"Yes, although I didnt expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that theyre needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in to years."
379,"Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May , months later."
380,Closest we got was about a month. The Model ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time from mid to mid . Production &amp; logistics hell.
381,"I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt."
382,"That funding round completed pm on Christmas Eve in . Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didnt own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time."
383,Yes
384,"Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge"
385,"As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year."
386,"Right now, it takes about mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky &amp; plug in!"
387,Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
388,Didnt realize that was possible. No problem if theres a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
389,"As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March."
390,"Lower latitude states need more satellites in position, so probably January"
391,Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week
392,New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.
393,Haha
394,Very close to actual expected flight!
395,"I could not be more excited about the new supercollider! That said, while it is considerably larger, I dont think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering."
396,"Sure, maybe in a month or so"
397,"Well, its basically a tank from the future thats road-legal, so yeah"
398,Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.
399,Yes
400,Penguin Random House should change the name to Random Penguin
401,"Sure, although it might be quite a short livestream! Lot can go wrong, but well provide video, warts &amp; all. You will see every frame that we do."
402,This is what matters most
403,"Weve tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass"
404,Lord of the
405,"Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater."
406,Minor
407,"Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw &amp; roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip &amp; land, would be a big win"
408,"But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready."
409,"Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win."
410,Every to days
411,"Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human"
412,"We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience."
413,Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard! Doing neural nets without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what theyre doing. Reality is the hardest sim.
414,Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.
415,This build should be noticeably better with interventions
416,Yes
417,"Ive spent more than half my life in California &amp; love the state. But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem. Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement."
418,And Sweden is still right with zero deaths Oct
419,"True. Also, fewer heart attacks, as way easier to pump blood in % gravity."
420,"Now were talking. Also, Stephenson -18 is in the constellation Scrotum haha."
421,Small fry. The sun converts over million tons of mass to energy every second.
422,Accurate
423,Some challenges with high winds. Looks like Sunday for static fire.
424,Great shot!
425,Future AI will appreciate this
426,Truth is stranger than fiction
427,Urf is so sml
428,For a long time
429,"Truth be told, Ive eaten at JitB many times over the years, even the teriyaki bowl"
430,Might buy a Jack in the Box footstool
431,"Approximately, log(rate)"
432,"Same bot, just change setting to combat"
433,"Well, being a phased array antenna, it is actually rather flat!"
434,Tesla should make catgirl robots?
435,Little crane: Am I just a toy to you!?
436,"Come here no, come, here"
437,"Wow, this mayo sure is salty!"
438,Max Payne was great on many levels. Silent Hill good too.
439,Jack in the Box should do double duty as a sperm donor clinic name is
440,One of the best games ever
441,FEAR with modern graphics &amp; sound would rock
442,Ok
443,All games in this thread are far scarier &amp; more creatively so than any horror movie
444,FEAR is best imo. Also Dead Space . They will haunt your dreams.
445,"To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades. Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas. GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories."
446,"All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life."
447,And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.
448,Bettern nothin or ur back!
449,Tesla team has done great work!
450,"Well, tbh, our capex efficiency in was trash"
451,Testing for covid is a license to print money
452,"Yes, very helpful. Thanks all beta testers!"
453,Video training &amp; inference is essential for excellent autonomy
454,"Sigh there should be a new supersonic jet, this time electric"
455,Critical to humanitys future
456,Congratulations SpaceX Team!
457,Mine is a few days ahead
458,"Sure, it could be an option in settings"
459,Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.
460,Sure
461,"Im in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see."
462,Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
463,Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
464,"Yup. With beta updates, therell be a lot of steps fwd, step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast."
465,Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
466,Starship is coming together!
467,Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
468,There will be a deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
469,"Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?"
470,Agreed. Are these performance tires?
471,"Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case."
472,Sure
473,"Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday"
474,"As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high s reliability (way beyond human)."
475,Yes
476,Haha
477,Dependent on proving high safety
478,"Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt)."
479,"Cold gas for now, hot later"
480,"I mean, ya gotta have a tiki bar"
481,"Starship nosecone, high bay &amp; tiki bar"
482,After it gets to orbit a few times
483,Got a little melty tbh
484,"Those engines could go bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesnt achieve anything, but Im confident Raptor will do bar for orbital flights."
485,Raptor has now run for secs at bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. R-Boost variant is aiming for ton thrust at bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.
486,"FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should."
487,Data from engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
488,Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.
489,Sweden at zero deaths Oct
490,Yes
491,"Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description, but yes"
492,"Mobi-C has too much mobility, fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha."
493,"Actually, its my neck"
494,"Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6, however st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely."
495,Pretty accurate. Its not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNA/RNA to fix bugs in our code &amp; inform immune system what to attack.
496,London to Beijing would be cool
497,"Wow, that would be quite a trip!"
498,Thats my kid haha
499,mtr trnd
500,Looks like snoopy
501,Current production is slightly better
502,Doesnt seem to be any life in this solar system. Maybe under the ice of Europa or extremophile bacteria below the surface of Mars. Worth reading:
503,Very creative
504,That free fusion reactor in the sky conveniently converts ~4 million tons of mass into energy every second. We just need to catch an extremely tiny amount of it to power all of civilization.
505,You never know
506,After
507,"Also, system should autodelete old data automatically by default"
508,Table in tension
509,Yes
510,"Starting production on seater next month, initial deliveries early December"
511,"The gauntlet has been thrown down! The prophecy will be fulfilled. Model S price changes to $69,420 tonight!"
512,More great renderings! Significant improvements coming to the welds.
513,Congratulations!
514,Making progress
515,meter or roughly ft diameter
516,Will be less roomy with vacuum rocket engines added
517,"Its still there, but focus is Vegas &amp; Prufrock, our new tunneling machine"
518,For sure
519,Maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations.
520,"We simplified this a lot. Its basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point, which is way more profound than it sounds."
521,Sweet
522,Yes. Everything is slow to a phased array antenna.
523,Nice
524,What is love? Baby dont hurt me. Winston Churchill
525,Or maybe weak turrets to allow more strategic degrees of freedom
526,Please buff Torbs turret!
527,Um yes
528,I have Goosebumps merch. Not sure how tbh.
529,HG2G
530,LotR
531,The Illuminaughty
532,Knee deep
533,Yeah
534,At least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time!
535,"Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but hes in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy."
536,"Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. Its just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian."
537,"With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasnt clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, its right."
538,"Thank you, much more accurate haha"
539,This graph appears to be upside down
540,"Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual."
541,Will release order configurator probably in Jan
542,"Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers."
543,"The SoCs sync with each other to times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so its fairly obvious when one is discordant"
544,"Tesla FSD computers dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails."
545,"Accurate analysis. Quite a few ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements."
546,Glad Jen is safe!
547,Wow
548,"Uh ok, here we go"
549,I dont think this is accurate
550,"Yeah, there are literally &gt;1000% more cameras than years ago, but still zero clear photos"
551,"Even if half that amount, its still a big deal!"
552,I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a /11 security cam frame grab dont count!
553,"We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. Its not a question of money. If there was a great engineer factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build."
554,Definitely
555,"Exactly. He plays the poor inventor card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in /2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent."
556,"There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhards problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July . Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 &amp; Zeev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 . After Q3 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO."
557,"When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all."
558,Interesting
559,SpaceX/Tesla metallurgy &amp; new materials team is next-level
560,Probably
561,I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!
562,"Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo."
563,Sweden was right
564,"There are sensitive elements, but theyre on the inside. Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what Ive posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what Ive posted doesnt need to reverse engineer!"
565,Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!
566,Our tiles are mechanically attached
567,It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
568,Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
569,"Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user."
570,Im proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha
571,Norway leads the world
572,Passed cryo proof
573,"Yeah, its not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case D printing, but casting doesnt work well for complex enclosed volumes &amp; high strength or high temp alloys."
574,Great pics!
575,Maybe this should be the flag of Mars
576,"Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation. Its already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is or years ahead of other companies in use of additive."
577,"Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note"
578,Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Wont need to wait for FSD.
579,It should be
580,Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close a tantalizing local maximum but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
581,"Yes, we will play sexy snake jazz"
582,Yes
583,"Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler"
584,"Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks."
585,"Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as %"
586,"Great render. Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand &amp; ship to booster."
587,Mimecraft
588,Yes
589,Autopilot team is making great progress. Reality sure is complicated!
590,"Aspiring to have no flame diverter in Boca, but this could turn out to be a mistake"
591,We do have giant steel balls haha
592,"We just completed a financing round, but will let you know when there is another one"
593,I definitely need to try these tasty cakes &amp; pastries on my next visit!
594,"Mass ratio. Liquid oxygen is much denser than liquid methane, even when the latter is cooled to just above its freezing point."
595,Had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of Tacheles. Too bad that place got torn down. It was awesome.
596,dner kebab
597,Youre most welcome!
598,High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
599,That looks tasty!
600,The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
601,Sandy Munro understands engineering
602,"That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one."
603,"Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product"
604,"Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough."
605,But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
606,Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in . Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
607,"The Model production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three."
608,"Bringing a new product to volume production is % inspiration &amp; % perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but its fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly."
609,Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
610,"Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I cant emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part."
611,We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
612,"Berlin will use cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system. Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven."
613,They are
614,I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
615,"bar absolute, which is fine for flight. This was a proof test, rather than a burst test. Well hopefully fix the leak today &amp; retest."
616,"Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking"
617,One of the best shots ever!
618,Much sooner
619,Great photo!
620,It will soon
621,"Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US &amp; hopefully southern Canada. Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval."
622,Were not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do + reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
623,Roughly a week or two turnaround is all thats needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
624,"Ahem, yes, it was the rd flight of this booster &amp; rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for + flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year."
625,th flight &amp; landing for this booster
626,minutes from launch. Looks good so far.
627,"So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another cars exhaust pipe."
628,"Its a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by . Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market."
629,Turn volume to &amp; play Powerglide in your Tesla
630,FSD will solve these issues
631,"Music volume on a Tesla goes to , because its louder than"
632,"One of my favorite writers. Foundation is tough to make into a movie, but has outstanding potential."
633,Rewatched Young Frankenstein this weekend. Still awesome. Ovaltine?
634,"The remake has the potential to be great. I kinda liked the original tbh, but its possible to take it up a level."
635,"Hollywood should just start with the sequel &amp; skip the original, because financials"
636,This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of or more presently &amp; X long-term
637,"Pretty wild, considering that Exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public years ago"
638,New SpaceX droneship will be called A Shortfall of Gravitas
639,"Nothing can escape gravity, not even black holes (and they really tried!)"
640,Would be cool to put yourself in the mind of the car while its driving
641,Coming soon
642,"Call of Booty, great game"
643,Vector-space birds eye view coming with FSD
644,Unexpected pressure rise in the turbomachinery gas generator
645,"All of that and more. Were doing a broad review of launch site, propulsion, structures, avionics, range &amp; regulatory constraints this weekend. I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person."
646,Exactly
647,We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing launches next year!
648,I agree with Lex
649,Glad youre ok!
650,Haha
651,Thanks for waiting!
652,Next year for sure
653,"Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes."
654,High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
655,Great
656,"Brownsville is quite far south, so probably months or so for good connectivity needs several more Starlink launches. Im using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet."
657,"Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) &amp; more ground stations are deployed. As were able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero."
658,Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
659,"Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming"
660,"Probably or with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isnt required for Mars, so is possible"
661,"Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged"
662,Yeah
663,"Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as were actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded."
664,"The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling."
665,Its next-level
666,Glad to hear your Mom is ok
667,Good to see. Inspiring for future of space!
668,The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
669,"Yes, coming soon"
670,Great render! The circumferential welds &amp; skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
671,Thats very hard to do. Have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open? Its designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic.
672,"Its cool &amp; for sure can &amp; should be done, but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind &amp; solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)"
673,Weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming Starships
674,Haha true. Why do showers have such a wide range!?
675,Yes
676,Light is not as fast as youd think
677,Maybe we used too many magenta spotlights
678,Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety
679,"We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. Im a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it."
680,Fate loooves irony haha
681,Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no Internet connectivity at all.
682,True
683,"Thats total market, not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching M vehicles/year probably before , but that requires consistently excellent execution."
684,Total market
685,"Seven years for sure to M+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials."
686,Both will do original cars
687,We arent cutting the price of Model to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model .
688,"What about a heavy duty, paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails?"
689,New version coming soon
690,"Suppliers. Were only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. Also, maybe the presentation wasnt clear that weve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard."
691,"If it passes Australian regulations, then sure"
692,Checking into it
693,"Totally up to you, but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners, that would be cool"
694,Completely agree
695,"Yes, the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics."
696,"Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics."
697,There are times when I feel like Im living in a Dilbert cartoon
698,That species has stood the test of time
699,"Mostly L, some . Broke at to interface. SN9 will be all . Also, were making some tweaks to the alloy mixture."
700,"bar differential in ullage, bar at base due to propellant head. Its enough. Improvements in work."
701,"We just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield &amp; go high Mach."
702,"First flight is to km or ~50,000 ft"
703,Nosecone &amp; front flaps next week. SN9 next month.
704,Starship SN8 with rear body flaps
705,Sure
706,True
707,Not bad
708,Exactly
709,Sandy Munro understands engineering
710,Turns out they mostly press the letter s &amp; on the typewriter
711,Centaur with a bow obviously
712,Haha
713,Something like this
714,Cant support wheel vehicles. Not safe enough.
715,~9007mm
716,"Something appealing about Hawking/Hartle idea, but I agree with Turok/Feldbrugge/Lehners"
717,ur algo
718,True
719,"There are some practical size constraints too. Cant be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But, it could be a little bigger. sec Isp would be nice."
720,"Doesnt seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given bar max demonstrated chamber pressure."
721,"Preburners ignite, then main chamber"
722,Where is our prediction of probability inaccurate?
723,"Or energy &amp; time, but besides that what?"
724,Genetic engineering is too slow unless you use a synthetic virus
725,What cant we predict?
726,"Yeah, but might not need it"
727,expansion ratio. You can a little bit of flow separation towards the end of the nozzle.
728,Only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
729,This does seem like the opposite of open. OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft.
730,Haha true
731,Maybe I will
732,Jets are so cool
733,Pretty much
734,Yes
735,Yahoo Finance is as dumb as it sounds
736,Yes
737,Haha
738,Roadster will be better
739,Probably
740,"Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster &amp; Semi C A R S"
741,Thanks for your many years of support through very tough times!
742,"We will be a little below that this year (most challenging year weve ever had), but probably above that next few years"
743,Thats about right. Maybe a little faster.
744,Yes
745,cgi irl
746,Haha
747,The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. Its % to % harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
748,Haha
749,"We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves."
750,"Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until ."
751,Thanks!
752,We really need better legs for Starship. Theyre coming.
753,"Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend."
754,"Fine, well do it already"
755,"Good analysis, although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature"
756,Im pretty sure Tesla could do a much better autocorrect. The bar is so low haha.
757,True
758,Custom ultra high speed bus &amp; efficient cooling
759,Ok
760,Pretty much any machine-learning
761,Its big
762,Sure
763,"Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs"
764,"There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off of the bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision."
765,"Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world."
766,You really want waypoints this much?
767,"For Dojo, were betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great."
768,Yes
769,Yes
770,"Therell be lots of green space around factory, but building itself is continuous. The open areas inside are covered. Theyre internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building."
771,Shaped like a diamond &amp; aligned on true north
772,"A prior track record of exceptional achievement in engineering *is* required, but *no* prior experience working on the brain or human physiology is required. We will teach you whats known about the brain, which is not much tbh."
773,"If you feel Neuralink might have incorrectly overlooked your resume or declined to make an offer, please lmk in comment below"
774,Felt I had done enough on the Internet (Zip2 &amp; PayPal) that my work would be useful to others. Needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy &amp; making life multiplanetary.
775,It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX &amp; Tesla success probabilities above ~zero
776,"To be frank, in the early days, I thought there was &gt;90% chance that both SpaceX &amp; Tesla would be worth $0. The press &amp; aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me."
777,Irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers
778,of course I still love you
779,"Sure, but which planet?"
780,Good movie
781,Current was too strong for droneship to hold station. Thrusters to be upgraded for future missions.
782,Lot has happened in years
783,It will be very insane
784,Speedrunning Factorio in real life
785,"No, but you make some great points. Important to note that irons cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem."
786,Yup
787,Fallout Shelter is on your Tesla. Tap the Entertainment button.
788,Implicit conflation of consumption &amp; capital allocation is the foundational error
789,Great idea!
790,Fallout Radio
791,There are some eerie parallels between The Boring Company &amp; Vault-Tec. We also built our first demonstration tunnel/vault in LA.
792,Doubles as an underground nuclear shelter
793,Yeah
794,Should be happening soon
795,"A bit more obscure, but Starhammer &amp; Stainless Steel Rat"
796,"At first, I thought that was a parrot"
797,They remind me of these guys
798,Story of my life
799,Tunnels under cities with self-driving electric cars will feel like warp drive First operational tunnel under Vegas almost done The
800,For sure
801,Good point
802,Have you hugged a tunnel today?
803,Good analysis
804,Exactly
805,"Gary the snail is still winning, but were gaining on him/her"
806,Embrace tunnels!
807,"Tunnels are the solution to traffic. You can have as many levels as you want. Usable tunnel depth far exceeds tallest buildings, so would work even for New York or Beijing."
808,"Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. Well build several ships just to improve the production system."
809,"Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration."
810,Couldnt agree more major software improvements are already in place to extend its life &amp; more coming
811,"Definitely not. Smartwatches &amp; phones are yesterdays technology, Neuralinks are the future."
812,Seems like they should make a whole outfit out of that material
813,Ancient Greece had it all &amp; then committed suicide. Nobody digs your grave better than yourself.
814,True
815,The LEGO Movie was awesome
816,"The Story of Civilization. First book is a little dry, but second book, The Life of Greece, is incredible."
817,Im wearing your F-1 engine shirt right now!
818,Cumulative mass to orbit per year (corrected for GTO &amp; other high energy orbits) is the best comparative metric imo
819,Thats the number that really matters
820,Anyone tracking tonnage to orbit per year for all launch vehicles?
821,"One way or another, excitement guaranteed! Support of greater Boca, Padre, Brownsville community is very much appreciated."
822,"SN8 Starship with flaps &amp; nosecone should be done in about a week. Then static fire, checkouts, static fire, fly to ft &amp; back."
823,Can someone do a boat service from South Padre to Boca?
824,Exactly. Problems like that have been addressed.
825,Yes. Good insight.
826,"All frames stitched to single frame (tricky, as all cameras overlap in different ways) &amp; then creating video segments for labeling &amp; training. Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten."
827,Much
828,Yes
829,"Releasing private beta in to weeks, public beta (early access owners who opt in) to weeks after that, then all US Tesla owners mid December. Above schedule is contingent upon not encountering major unexpected setbacks."
830,And this still isnt using the dramatically better D (aka simultaneous surround video from cameras) architecture
831,Cool
832,He has no clue
833,Sorry to hear that. Im sure youll figure it out though. Took us four launches to reach orbit. Rockets are hard.
834,Many exciting things will be unveiled on Battery Day /22
835,We will make super efficient home hvac with hepa filters one day
836,"If Reich actually cares about global warming, why is he making so much hot air!?"
837,Natrlich
838,Bitte arbeiten Sie bei Tesla Giga Berlin! Es wird super Spa machen!!
839,Try a Tesla &amp; youre welcome to give it back if you decide you prefer a Subaru
840,Vera Rubin Observatory is cool
841,Munger is right
842,Black-Scholes formula is kinda bs. Big difference between a finance approximation &amp; fundamental physics / pure math.
843,True
844,"Tesla is best understood as a collection of about a dozen startups, mostly in series, increasingly in parallel. Every product line &amp; new production system was invented. Instead of playing chess with the same pieces as everyone else, create new pieces."
845,Tesla R&amp productivity is exceptionally good due to the caliber of engineering talent
846,Tesla Model S &amp; X have hospital-grade (HEPA) air filters. &amp; Y are really good too. This has a big effect on health.
847,Touch
848,"All Tesla workers also get stock, so their compensation increased proportionately. You are a modern day moron."
849,Yup
850,"Rawlinson didnt design Model S. Prototype was done before he joined &amp; he left us in the lurch just as things got tough, which was not cool. He did make some contributions to body/chassis engineering, but not to powertrain, battery, electronics or software."
851,Were pretty close to the manufacturing size limit for a milled copper &amp; steel jacket nozzle. Lot of complexity to add a nozzle extension to a sea level engine for small gain. Also hard to fit bigger engine nozzles on the booster.
852,A la guerre comme la guerre
853,Haha
854,And starts tweeting
855,"If you bombard Earth with enough photons, eventually it emits a Tesla (AK)"
856,There is already bidirectional communication between human &amp; AI via phones &amp; computers. Its just lossy &amp; very slow (especially output)
857,Above % likely to make it
858,This is a test engine. Flight articles are fixed with no gimbal.
859,Worth noting that thrust is only slightly higher with the big bell nozzle version. Larger bell is primarily for efficiency in vacuum. Aiming for + sec Isp for RVac long-term. Initially likely to be ~372.
860,Yes
861,Chart understates lithium-ion potential by roughly /3
862,Model rated as most reliable car
863,Turns out you can make anything fly haha
864,Exactly. This is not fully appreciated.
865,"Starship SN6 flew asimilar hop to SN5, but it was a much smoother &amp; faster operation"
866,Giga Berlin Mannschaft Vielen Dank fr Ihre hervorragende Arbeit an Giga Berlin!!
867,Great trip to Germany. Support from government &amp; people is super appreciated!
868,Trust ur butt haha
869,An AI with picking as its goal will result in Strawberry Fields Forever
870,"Over time, outer will have ~300 tons of thrust &amp; inner ~210, so roughly tons total at sea level or T/W for booster+ship"
871,Yeah
872,Just go through resonant modes fast. Its when you hang out there that problems arise.
873,"The outer ring of booster engines (20 of ) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center TVC &amp; differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever."
874,Videodrome
875,"Sorry, sir I think I have momentinertiaphobia"
876,Yeah
877,LHC tbh
878,"If you ever want to build a long accelerator tunnel, straight or circular, I know some people"
879,Cool
880,"Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation"
881,"If some company has solved a useful thing that we can just buy, that would be great! Its so much work to create our own tech. We develop new tech, because we have to, not because we want to."
882,"Tesla Germany designed &amp; built the vaccine RNA printers for CureVac, but, subject to some CureVac IP, they could be made for other companies too"
883,"Technically, James Watt measured a pony, added % &amp; rounded up haha"
884,"Also, Critical Thinking"
885,Alexander and the Rise of Hellenism and Film Studies
886,"Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind."
887,"Yeah, he sent it to me through a mutual physics prof friend at Caltech/CERN. Very basic stuff."
888,Its too embarrassing
889,Just learned that my physics prof from Penn is head of Fermilab &amp; still has some of my old homework
890,"It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas &amp; underweight bringing them to fruition. For example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard."
891,"People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions &amp; a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect."
892,That &amp; Giga Berlin are why Im headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas.
893,"Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as or weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells"
894,Yeah
895,"One person at Tesla (out of ) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was."
896,"Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldnt blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval."
897,Not yet
898,Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.
899,"People read too much into this level of detail. Its not useful for predicting the future, nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term, fine-grained level."
900,Critical feedback is always appreciated btw
901,"We cant have a blanket pass, but maybe for some events"
902,"Booster design has shifted to four legs with a wider stance (to avoid engine plume impingement in vacuum), rather than six"
903,Later versions of a larger device would have that potential
904,Yup
905,"Actually C, although the syntax could be improved esthetically"
906,"I like C, because it avoids class warfare"
907,A nightcap would probably work best
908,Pretty much
909,Good summary
910,Conceptual telepathy
911,Ahem starting soon
912,"All of physics is either impossible or trivial. It is impossible until you understand it, and then it becomes trivial. E Rutherford"
913,Giant gap between experimental medical device for use only in patients with extreme medical problems &amp; widespread consumer use. This is way harder than making a small number of prototypes.
914,Testing with shorter RVac skirt went well. Full length skirt test coming soon.
915,Neuralink product demo in hours. Webcast at .
916,"Raptor reached mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a + ton engine in about to months. Target for booster is tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust."
917,"Good chance something will slip, but, yeah, Sunday is intense"
918,Only need engines
919,Boring Co tunnel in Vegas is only a few months from being operational
920,"Neuralink this month &amp; Tesla next month, SpaceX probably October. We will have made a lot of progress by then. Might have a prototype booster hop done by then."
921,Soon
922,Theyre quite accurate!
923,That number sure comes up a lot
924,Im fine with reasonable drone footage. Just needs to be at a fair distance &amp; not coming right up to people. I think our security was a little overzealous in this case.
925,Thanks to a smart and hardworking team at Tesla. These sure are wild times
926,Much appreciated. This was a serious attack.
927,Brave Starhopper carried the day
928,Only so many days
929,"We were too obtuse for our own good, although I think it works esthetically. Those are folded-over current collectors at the top/bottom of the cell, which are important, but I dont want to jump the gun on Sept"
930,"But actually nothing. Was surprised to hear theyre across the road. Adding silicon to carbon anode makes sense. We already do. Question is just what ratio of silicon to carbon &amp; what shape? Silicon expands like crazy during discharge &amp; comes apart, so cycle life is usually bad."
931,Nothing
932,Then they leave the house and hardly ever call their parents!
933,"The Big Bang started very, very sml"
934,Asimov was

937,Was just there &amp; weather was calm. Sure hope it stays that way!
938,Tesla brake lights are powered by a miniverse inside a microverse
939,Exactly
940,"No, were focused on developing new products &amp; scaling production"
941,"Yes, will show V2. Still far from LASIK, but could get pretty close in a few years."
942,Lengthy background on Neuralink by

944,Astronaughty
945,No
946,"Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day."
947,"Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. Thats probably faster."
948,Now I want candy
949,Theres a lot of frozen CO2 &amp; H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. Its solvable.
950,Perhaps one day there will be an ocean on the northern part of Mars
951,Its almost working reliably
952,"Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we dont need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately."
953,Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory &amp; super high bandwidth between cores &amp; efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
954,No &amp; not possible at this scale
955,Orbital launch mount
956,"Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / miles clear area for noise."
957,Sure
958,On it
959,"I tried to warn them, but they just dug their own grave twice as fast!"
960,"Wh/kg *with* high cycle life, produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. Probably to years."
961,"Starship/Super Heavy, which is ~10X mass of Zenit, will mostly launch from ocean spaceports long-term"
962,Starship/Super Heavy is ~10X bigger in mass &amp; volume
963,A metaphor for life

977,Dankeschn Brandenburg &amp; Grnheide!
978,True
979,Medical check is A-ok!
980,He might run for President in
981,Not having long chain hydrocarbons &amp; lowering preburner combustion temperature make a big difference
982,Yes
983,Yes
984,Absolutely needs liquid cooling. Were applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers.
985,"Thats an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease."
986,We will push for ten flights with Starlink
987,"Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine."
988,"Mostly for employees, but well support public access whenever its safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary."
989,Absolutely
990,"I dont want be cavalier, but there isnt an obvious limit. + flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine."
991,"Ive been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though."
992,Dojo V1.0 isnt done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
993,Scorcher VI
994,Yes
995,Elevator music is underrated
996,"Its counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!"
997,"Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so youre roughly even with flights, definitely ahead with"
998,"Yes, it will have huge nuts haha"
999,"We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!"
1000,"My favorite is one in tension, other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut."
1001,Yes
1002,"Aloha, welcome back from space"
1003,"Yeah, will post shortly"
1004,Winning worst person Ive ever worked with is not easy. Some real champions are vying for that title!
1005,Fairing chute control &amp; ship control are closing the loop locally. Both operating on (SpaceX) autopilot.

1008,Must be aliens
1009,Yes
1010,This little spit of dirt will take us to Mars
1011,Humans are swiftly becoming a small percentage of total compute
1012,"Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons, so theyre actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound."
1013,Thats engine SN. Were building SN8 of the ship.
1014,"SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over bar engine. For reference, bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force."
1015,Raptor engine just reached bar chamber pressure without exploding!
1016,"Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at km. Hard to see with naked eye. Well do lots of flights."
1017,"Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger &amp; therell be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing."
1018,This might sting a little
1019,The early investor part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person Ive ever worked with and thats saying something!) for years.
1020,"Also, there could be long period comets that intersect Earth right now. We just havent observed them during humanitys (very short) recorded history. Comet S-L punched a roughly Earth-sized hole in Jupiter."
1021,Pretty much
1022,Cybertruck option package

1034,History is written by the victors except on Wikipedia haha
1035,Cover of Barbie Girl
1036,Yes. Probably more accurate to say Great Filters plural.
1037,"Yes, its called Cyber Girl"
1038,We must pass The Great Filter
1039,Sounds right

1043,"Metal has a fudge-like consistency near its melting point, so you can just smoosh it together"
1044,This is how we make Falcon
1045,"This is out of our hands, so hard to predict. Maybe on order of billion km of real world driving will be enough to convince regulators."
1046,Yes
1047,hasty govt
1048,"A lot of work remains. Technically, we have it working in sim with FPGAs at ~0.01% capability. This will be a true supercomputer."
1049,Dojo is still being built. Maybe a year or so from V1.0.
1050,"Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not."
1051,Your insights over the years have been excellent. Thats approximately right.
1052,"Absolutely, but it doesnt seem that govt can move fast enough"
1053,Ok
1054,It will blow ur mind haha
1055,"Our main engineering locations are Palo Alto, Austin &amp; Seattle, but working remotely is acceptable for exceptional candidates"
1056,"I want to do electric vtol supersonic sooo bad, but my brain will overload"
1057,"Asteroid impact risk is well understood, but not comets. Those worry me."
1058,Great mission patch design!
1059,Haha true
1060,Yup
1061,Exactly
1062,"Also definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didnt have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily."
1063,"Sorry, this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now."
1064,"Yes! Were labeling bumps &amp; potholes, so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so."
1065,"Not perfectly at first, but yes. Will take maybe a year or so to get really good at roundabouts worldwide. The world has a zillion weird corner cases."
1066,This is what I meant by D
1067,"The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because its a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in to weeks."
1068,Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. Its a beast! Please consider joining our AI or computer/chip teams if this sounds interesting.
1069,More software improvements coming
1070,"Significant improvements coming to S/X air suspension soon via software update! Will simultaneously improve performance handling &amp; ride comfort &amp; enable user customization of height &amp; damping, geocoded for relevance."
1071,"H2O, CH4/CO2, N2, iron, nickel, chrome, aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel"
1072,What are the odds ?
1073,"The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI to years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point."
1074,Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production
1075,SN8
1076,Impressive
1077,Psyche
1078,"Yes, integrated with the tip of the nose"
1079,This is important
1080,Probably not faster than utility power can be restored. Powerwall/Powerpack/Megapack can certainly be helpful long-term.
1081,Starship fairing will actually have more height than shown here. Dome will be flatter &amp; more of tip is accessible. Usable volume ~1000 cubic meters.
1082,You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.
1083,So why is this madness acceptable for Boeing/Lockheed rockets?
1084,Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once &amp; then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd
1085,I generally try my best not to be on patents
1086,"Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary &amp; space power. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money."
1087,"Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails."
1088,Sorry to hear this. What can we do to help?
1089,No surprise
1090,Aiming to make it super fun!
1091,A little toastier each flight
1092,"Same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion &amp; body bending."
1093,SN7 will be new alloy test tank taken to burst pressure. SN8 will have body flaps &amp; nosecone.
1094,SN &amp; at Starship Production Complex in Texas
1095,"One day soon, I will wear this outfit"
1096,I was trying to channel Herb Tarlek from WKRP
1097,Note the fabulous plaid jacket &amp; gingham shirt combo
1098,Twin Peaks
1099,Working on my Moms cousins farm in Saskatchewan at age . I think we did a barn-raising that day.
1100,"Not sure yet, but hopefully. Will need leg &amp; other repairs. Probably SN6 flies before SN5. We need to make flights simple &amp; easy many per day."
1101,Clearly
1102,Also true
1103,"Over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round, where I owned ~60% of Tesla to today at ~20%, it has declined by a factor of ."
1104,I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed
1105,"And why aim your attacks at Tesla, when were doing more than any other company on Earth to advance green/sustainable energy? Have you read the news?"
1106,That bs was pushed by oil &amp; gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. Bernard Sanders is a docile puppet of big oil!
1107,"Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies."
1108,"Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short"
1109,"Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height."
1110,I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
1111,It will look crazy tall with booster &amp; fairing at m / ft
1112,Ok
1113,"Apart from failing to quarantine elderly/at-risk people early (a mistake they recognize), they were right"
1114,Good piece on Giga Berlin construction
1115,This seems increasingly likely
1116,This is gonna be great
1117,SN5
1118,"Well do several short hops to smooth out launch process, then go high altitude with body flaps"
1119,Soon
1120,"V1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider &amp; taller like Falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces &amp; auto-leveling."
1121,Progress is accelerating
1122,Exactly
1123,Mars is looking real
1124,Possible flight in mins
1125,Most likely
1126,True
1127,Highly likely down the road
1128,True fact
1129,"Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didnt open, triggering an automatic abort. Well figure out why &amp; retry tomorrow."
1130,Im in the Boca control room. Hop attempt in ~33 minutes.
1131,For sure
1132,"Tbh, I must confess to occasionally pontificating about high-concept things"
1133,Pretty much
1134,"Nosecone closing is recommended, but not required, for safe entry"
1135,"When space travel becomes as common as air travel, the future of civilization will be assured"
1136,Space is the new air
1137,Congratulations &amp; on completing first crewed Dragon flight!! returned.
1138,Dragon is stable in the water
1139,Acquisition of signal expected in mins
1140,mins to Dragon loss of signal due to atmospheric entry plasma
1141,Dragon will travel from south of New Zealand to Florida in ~37 minutes
1142,Coming in hot
1143,Astronauts land in hours
1144,"However, we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover"
1145,"All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes."
1146,Great game
1147,Working on it
1148,The simplest solution is not necessarily the most satisfying
1149,Absolutely. Long-lasting art is incredibly difficult.
1150,This BBC article provides a sensible summary for how it was done
1151,"The Great Pyramid was the tallest structure made by humans for years. Three thousand, eight hundred years."
1152,So true
1153,Ramses II was
1154,Aliens built the pyramids obv
1155,Ancient Egypt had an incredible esthetic that stands to this day
1156,Witch logic
1157,"Things we take for granted, like flying, would have had you burned at the stake for witchcraft not that long ago"
1158,Engineering is magic made real
1159,Lo Que Construimos
1160,Cool
1161,Starship SN5 just completed full duration static fire. m hop soon.
1162,Total Eclipse of the Heart
1163,Not that Im aware of
1164,Yes. Could also extend range of hearing beyond normal frequencies and amplitudes. Deus Ex.
1165,"Neuralinks are currently meant for mature brains &amp; functionality is lost if removed. Rewiring of neurons is certainly possible, but wont make up for loss of the Link."
1166,"Yes, should be possible to create a neural shunt from motor cortex to microcontrollers in muscle groups &amp; restore movement even if someone has a fully severed spinal cord. First part has already been demonstrated with Utah array, but not as an outpatient device."
1167,Will show neurons firing in real-time on August th. The matrix in the matrix.
1168,They dont fire all at once. Some go several seconds to minutes without firing. Some fire several times per second. Very wide timing distribution.
1169,Congrats on a great launch!
1170,But sometimes when we touch
1171,Adagio for Strings is great
1172,Losing It
1173,Mein Herz Brennt. Best boss battle song ever.
1174,Robot Heart is
1175,One of the all time best
1176,Sure
1177,Sure could use a good rave Whats your favorite techno
1178,I I just died in your arms tonight
1179,The rumor that Bill Gates &amp; I are lovers is completely untrue
1180,Yeah. Display will also soon render Teslas specifically as their model &amp; color instead of as a generic sedan/SUV. Has potential for a fun punch buggy sort of game.
1181,"Weve been working on this for about years. Originally meant for rabies vaccine, but it can make pretty much anything thats an RNA sequence. Critical path is completing human trials."
1182,Billy G is not my lover
1183,Sounds like he doesnt realize Tesla makes the vaccine machine for CureVac
1184,Thanks for letting me know. Will dig into it.
1185,Sum &gt; parts
1186,"Should add a few miles of range, more in slow traffic"
1187,The government has the most money by far. They talk in trillions.
1188,Haha no one can ever have our top secret fart technology!!
1189,Sure
1190,"Tesla is open to licensing software and supplying powertrains &amp; batteries. Were just trying to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors!"
1191,What he doesnt appear to appreciate is that government is just a monopolist corporation in the limit
1192,Agreed
1193,Haha
1194,Its a prototype of the color
1195,And to think I used to like Bernie!
1196,Maybe hes feeling the bern haha
1197,"Fuel spin valve didnt open. Will fix &amp; try again tomorrow. Also, some odd TVC hydraulic pump behavior."
1198,"I was just out at the launch pad. Connector damaged in the storm, but fixed now. Might be able to fire tonight or at least get to the next issue."
1199,"Whether commercial or government, monopolies are bad for the people"
1200,Sounds great
1201,Haha
1202,Das Kapital in a nutshell
1203,What I like most is their great sense of humor
1204,The left is losing the middle
1205,Exactly
1206,Hold my beer
1207,"Once an Onion, now a Rose"
1208,"Wow, you think about me a lot!"
1209,You dropped this
1210,Haha
1211,Giga Berlin will come together at an impossible-seeming speed. The prefabricated construction method in Germany is extremely impressive.
1212,Almost a decade ago. Original Dragon in background.
1213,Ya just cant beat BR
1214,Planet Claire is
1215,Fair point! Will discuss with team.
1216,He was amazing
1217,Great song
1218,"Nickel is the biggest challenge for high-volume, long-range batteries! Australia &amp; Canada are doing pretty well. US nickel production is objectively very lame. Indonesia is great!"
1219,Thats me! Haha
1220,This has a lot of potential. Lithium is pretty much everywhere.
1221,Whoa cool
1222,Has to be blue steel
1223,"We need high Brinell hardness &amp; high corrosion resistance. Because of Cybertrucks faceted nature, formability is not important."
1224,I really want to do this! Will be great fun. Could be both LA and Austin.
1225,Turning them into shade for an outdoor restaurant here in Boca
1226,Cool
1227,Yes
1228,Not impossible
1229,Those were the days!
1230,Ring of Fire
1231,I know! Congratulations to the people of Bolivia !!
1232,The song I whistle most is Strangers in the Night
1233,Some of whom seriously think Tesla toppled the Bolivian govt (sigh)
1234,Great song
1235,Haha thanks Kara
1236,For sure
1237,"Yeah, were hunkering down here until the hurricane passes"
1238,Exactly!
1239,Cool Model review by
1240,Tesla will add a power lift gate at no cost
1241,"Agreed, hydrogen fool sells make no sense"
1242,Pronouns suck
1243,"Also, we get our lithium from Australia"
1244,"Yeah, would have been way better just to send everyone $6k"
1245,I bet no one on Twitter even *has* a guillotine! Poseurs
1246,[slow drag on cigarette) Facebook? Havent heard that name in years
1247,Twitter sucks
1248,"Something like that. If politicians could legislate wealth, everyone would be a trillionaire."
1249,"These are jammed to gills with special interests earmarks. If we do a stimulus at all, it should just be direct payments to consumers."
1250,Pretty much
1251,"Goal of government should be to maximize the happiness of the people. Giving each person money allows them to decide what meets their needs, rather than the blunt tool of legislation, which creates self-serving special interests."
1252,"As a reminder, Im in *favor* of universal basic income"
1253,Another government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people imo
1254,Tesla solar panels are $1.49/Watt
1255,Thank you on behalf of the Tesla team. We look forward to building Giga Texas!
1256,Competition ensures companies work hard to serve the needs of their customers
1257,Something fun is coming
1258,Could be great!
1259,Thats a great idea!
1260,"We are actually looking for revolutionary actuaries for Tesla Insurance! Please inquire, if interested."
1261,"Tbh, we are just a bit less foolish than before"
1262,"Retail investors like are remarkably insightful. Also, ."
1263,"Especially for boost stage, which is volumetrically constrained, CH4 is way better than H2. Soviet CH4 engine prototypes from s were very advanced. Glad to see reusability is being factored in."
1264,"Basically, our pixel size"
1265,Cant emphasize this enough
1266,Absolutely
1267,Haha
1268,Agreed
1269,My oven keeps asking for my wifi password. Its not gonna get it.
1270,Impressive Tianwen-1 Mars rover mission launched by China today
1271,Good article
1272,Similar problem with US data
1273,Good point
1274,"You dont have a soul, you are a soul"

1286,Nothing has gaslit more people than the movie Gaslight
1287,"Well said, Brian Williams!"
1288,Great shot!
1289,"Sometimes, thats how I feel too!"
1290,Will attempt to fly later this week
1291,Sound &amp; flame color will be quite different
1292,Yes
1293,"Were rapidly changing alloy constituents &amp; forming methods, so traditional names like L will become more of an approximation"
1294,"At some point, we should probably do advertising as art/communication/entertainment &amp; to support high quality media"
1295,Das baby kann noch keinen lffel benutzen
1296,Its almost right
1297,We talked about an hour ago. He seems fine.
1298,VR Twitter with avatars saying the mentions
1299,Better to put the money into the product than sales &amp; marketing!
1300,We should bring Life to Mars
1301,Both fairing halves caught from space by ships!
1302,"Nice work, SpaceX team!"
1303,Still long way to go. Reuse only matters to degree that its rapid &amp; complete.
1304,Too long since we were last there
1305,Launch in mins
1306,In a few months in production release. Already does that in alpha build.
1307,Lithium is extremely common on Earth. Found almost everywhere.
1308,Congratulations MHI &amp; UAE!

1314,Will discuss on Wed earnings call. Lots to talk about!
1315,Yes
1316,This looks cool
1317,It has that potential
1318,"Good article. I started The Boring Company as a joke, but now its digging real tunnels!"
1319,"Its not really set up for tours, but maybe it should"
1320,Manufactured only mins from LAX!
1321,"Some contribute more. Y chromosome &amp; mitochondria are constant, except for mutations."
1322,Yes
1323,"That is just one part of the surgery. For this to scale, it must be fully automated, like LASIK."
1324,This would solve a lot of brain/spine injuries &amp; is ultimately essential for AI symbiosis
1325,Fermi was awesome. He understood the right questions to ask.
1326,BDE
1327,How come Hulk never loses pants!?
1328,Yes
1329,No prior neuroscience background is required. This is primarily an electrical/electronic (chip design)/mechanical/software engineering problem for the Link itself &amp; the surgical robot.
1330,"Solving high-volume, high-reliability, low-cost production problems is especially valued"
1331,"If youve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering.com"

1334,Its inevitable
1335,"Excuse me, I only sell Doge!"
1336,Will those who write the algorithms ever realize their negativity bias?
1337,Pretty much
1338,We better hustle with Neuralink. Not moving fast enough.
1339,Thanks
1340,Just stop
1341,Gigafactory is the product even more than the car
1342,Yes
1343,Carefully hidden
1344,Sure
1345,Might be an indoor/outdoor rave space on the roof
1346,Giga Berlin
1347,"Exactly, this is a serious problem. Ratio of retirees to workers is tracking towards unsustainability in many countries. An upside down demographic pyramid is unstable."
1348,Considering
1349,Small note: latch on post near base is gone &amp; powered Ethernet wire is less obtrusive in production version
1350,"This thing we call money is just a (slow, lossy &amp; unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people, at least until AGI happens, which will obviate need for labor &amp; necessitate UBI."
1351,Trying to set a good example haha. Mars needs people!
1352,Great work by Tesla software engineering
1353,Population collapse is nd biggest danger to civilization after AI imo
1354,"Yeah, will take less than a minute to order on when it goes live"
1355,"Starlink terminal has motors to self-orient for optimal view angle. No expert installer required. Just plug in &amp; give it a clear view of the sky. Can be in garden, on roof, table, pretty much anywhere, so long as it has a wide view of the sky."
1356,Ok
1357,"To revolutionize space, the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale dont lie."
1358,Exactly
1359,"Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation. Also, what about Autobahn!?"
1360,"The strength &amp; perseverance of the people of Tesla, despite facing extreme difficulties"
1361,Playable on any Tesla!
1362,Should do this automatically
1363,"Mass to orbit is a more accurate metric than of launches, although should be orbit-adjusted (eg GTO&gt;LEO), which would increase competitor mass numbers"
1364,Cute
1365,Wow
1366,Reusability is essential. A rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane. F9 engines already fire times per flight.
1367,Wild times!
1368,Were being extra paranoid. Maximizing probability of successful launch is paramount.
1369,Welcome anytime
1370,"Well, I do care very much about sustainability of civilization, but there is some truth to the irony part haha"
1371,"Yes, in plan. Superchargers and public high power wall connectors will keep growing exponentially every year."
1372,I think so
1373,"Doing range testing now. Number will be significantly higher than . Extremely good for any EV, especially an SUV."
1374,"We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor &amp; will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent"
1375,Yes
1376,It may be able to reach kW at low states of charge
1377,"No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; mile EPA)"
1378,"We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S/X to reduce resistive heating. Technically, wont be quite mph charging, as X especially is much bigger than ."
1379,Hell of a ride!
1380,Thanks
1381,That is the near-term danger of AI
1382,I didnt mind DA2. DA1 was awesome. Mass Effect (talking about sequels) is amazing.
1383,Haha
1384,Maybe he should design flag of Mars

1388,SPQR
1389,True haha
1390,Death is the loss of information
1391,Earning power post augmentation would easily pay for itself (if thats even necessary). This is the best thing I can think of to ensure that collective human will decides the future.
1392,Absolutely
1393,Probably a good one to design &amp; engineer in Germany
1394,Even more
1395,Ok
1396,Berlin Model Y is the one to watch. That is a revolution in automotive body engineering (finally).
1397,True
1398,"Wow, IHOP &amp; GitHub are close"
1399,Best use of the term Full Stack?
1400,For sure. This is both great &amp; terrifying. Everything weve ever sensed or thought has been electrical signals. The early universe was just a soup of quarks &amp; leptons. How did a very small piece of the Universe start to think of itself as sentient?
1401,Yes
1402,"Sorry, should hopefully be soon!"
1403,"Not actually a payout, just a vesting of stock options. It may never pay out, as the stock cant be sold for years after exercise. The stock must be bought &amp; income taxes paid, then hold value for years."

1448,"North American Supercharger usage is now at pre-covid high, Europe about a week behind, China &amp; Asia-Pacific in general doing great"
1449,Sorry to hear about this. Hope you get back to orbit soon. Rockets are hard.
1450,You have my full support!
1451,Please take a moment to report accounts clearly engaged in harassment. It is the only way to maintain public discourse.
1452,Happy th of July!!
1453,That would be great
1454,"Agreed, but its hard to ignore what is effectively a social media denial of service attack"
1455,"Accounts that unequivocally advocate harassment should be suspended with warning, then shut down if repeated"
1456,True
1457,"Yeah, but why? Im working on sustainable energy cars &amp; solar that help Earth and making life multiplanetary, to ensure its continuance, with SpaceX."
1458,"Thanks, that would promote good public discourse"

1463,"To the best our knowledge, he never toured SpaceX. Dont know where that comes from."
1464,I was at that Vanity Fair party with . Dont know Ghislaine. Real question is why did VF invite her?
1465,"Now youre unblocked, so stop whining"
1466,I only block people as a direct insult
1467,"Yes. Green card (permanent residency) is fine too for SpaceX, according to ITAR rules."
1468,"Yeah, Tesla app would enable you to release your car into the fleet &amp; summon it back at will"
1469,"Directly, my companies employ roughly people. However, there is a massive global supply &amp; logistics chain that employs to times that number."
1470,"RWD is slightly more efficient, but dual motor AWD is faster &amp; more agile"
1471,Congrats Tesla Team U ROK!!
1472,"damn, hoist on my own petard!"
1473,"I dont have an emerald mine, nor was I given free money from anyone, inheritance or otherwise. Ashlee Vance interviewed hundreds of people. Ask him."
1474,Good point
1475,Thanks for hosting me in Tulsa today!
1476,"This is false. I landed in Montreal at age with $2000, a backpack of clothes &amp; suitcase of books. My father is bankrupt &amp; has been for a long time. I inherited literally nothing from him."
1477,She photobombed me at a Vanity Fair Oscar party. Was there with . Dont know Ghislaine at all. Why do you think it should be a bigger story?
1478,"Greenspan is crackers, bananas, barky &amp; ten cards short of a full deck"
1479,"Others will probably pass human trials first, but this machine is pretty special for generalized vaccine production. Was originally intended for rabies, which is a very tricky virus."
1480,Interesting
1481,"Good point, we dont"
1482,Coming soon
1483,HCL appears to be effective when used early
1484,"Unfortunately, there are thousands of automotive design rule differences between US &amp; EU, including completely different charge ports. Gets worse every year. Not our choice."
1485,Theres that too. Deaths should be broken out as died with vs died of.
1486,Deaths continue to trend down
1487,"Were seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of % to %. Article says testing went from k to k, which means a -fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially no symptoms, are false positives."
1488,Yes
1489,"The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about &amp; how prominently theyre placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative."
1490,Klippenstein has gone full twitter troll. Big mistake. Never go full troll!
1491,"Oh yeah, Klip Einstein, pseudojournalist &amp; douche-about-town"
1492,Someone is paying for hundreds of bots &amp; trolls to push this lame Vanity Fair photobomb pic. I wonder who
1493,true
1494,This is false. I have never introduced either of them to anyone.
1495,Yeah
1496,Sounds sketch
1497,Pretty much
1498,Haute couture
1499,Thanks!
1500,Dont know Ghislaine at all. She photobombed me once at a Vanity Fair party several years ago. Real question is why VF invited her in the first place
1501,"Thanks Viv, you rock"
1502,"Sure, we will aim to do a cross-country drive with Cybertruck later this year"
1503,Ok fine
1504,Exactly
1505,Yes
1506,Thanks Tesla owners &amp; investors! Love you!! We will work super hard to earn your trust &amp; support.
1507,Thank goodness! Front license plates make my eyes bleed.
1508,Not bad
1509,But sooo satisfying
1510,"SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elons"
1511,Will send some to the Shortseller Enrichment Commission to comfort them through these difficult times
1512,Should have a free trade agreement with US. No tariffs at all either way.
1513,I worried we wont be taken seriously if our short shorts have flames
1514,He wore them well. No denying it.
1515,Busted! I secretly short shorts.
1516,Tesla will make fabulous short shorts in radiant red satin with gold trim
1517,Great interview
1518,Yes
1519,Sellers of medium height or above are fine
1520,Those dang budgie smugglers!!
1521,Who wears short shorts?
1522,Great song
1523,Awesome!!
1524,Thank you. Angie
1525,bs
1526,"You cherry-picked one state out of fifty, which saw a minor uptick. Show the whole country."
1527,I tried to warn them
1528,Yup
1529,"Somethings messed up about medicine thats anti-science. In science, you question everyone, no matter who they are. Facts &amp; reasoning are everything, but in medicine too much emphasis is on credentials, often by people whove accomplished nothing but a PhD thesis used by no one."
1530,Heres one:
1531,"Yes, Angela, please show us the graphs/data that prove your point"
1532,"Im not building anything on ethereum. Not for or against it, just dont use it or own any."
1533,Lithium is common. Hard part is turning lithium salt or clay into extremely pure LiOH.
1534,"Yes, at Tesla Grohmann"
1535,"Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac &amp; possibly others"
1536,"In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem."
1537,"As youd expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case %, worst case % false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy."
1538,Seems fishy
1539,very true
1540,"A lot of functionality will happen all at once when we transition to the new software stack. Most likely, it will be releasable in to months. Then its a question of what functionality is proven safe enough to enable for owners."
1541,"Going well. Team is kicking ass &amp; its an honor to work with them. Pretty much everything had to be rewritten, including our labeling software, so that its fundamentally D at every step from training through inference."
1542,Crassus was a dick
1543,Haha awesome
1544,Hell of a decade
1545,I love Texas! Starship production complex is in Boca Chica &amp; SpaceX engine development has been in McGregor for almost years.
1546,Aiming for km with lots of turns to better approximate a real-world tunnel
1547,"You just have to be a shareholder. There is limited space, so sign up fast when we do final confirmation of date &amp; location."
1548,"Wow, Ive never seen this level of support! Out of respect, seems like I should at least visit."
1549,We need to finish building a much longer vacuum tunnel for speed tests &amp; probably have an additional competition for tunneling itself
1550,"All questions will be answered on Battery Day, Sept th. Will be webcast, although there is much to see in person."
1551,"Tesla Impact Report (repost). We do everything humanly possible to source materials &amp; produce sustainable energy cars, batteries &amp; solar ethically. Suggestions for improvement are always appreciated."
1552,"Things often dont translate from mice to humans, but thats promising"
1553,Likely true
1554,Yes
1555,Starlink will provide global coverage
1556,Worth discussing at annual shareholders meeting
1557,Party on
1558,Fixing
1559,"Extremely big difference between died because of or died with. Also, did the person actually have C19 or did they just have C19 symptoms? Its almost impossible to die without feeling weakness, shortness of breath or other C19 symptoms, unless you were crushed by a falling piano."
1560,Your GPS just got slightly better
1561,This bill needs to be revoked. It gives absurd power to county bureaucrats.
1562,"If accurate, this would explain a lot"
1563,Levitt is right
1564,"There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with % false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million fake C19 cases even if there were actually none."
1565,Very much agree
1566,Good hygiene always makes sense
1567,True
1568,Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
1569,"There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest."
1570,"Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla."
1571,Great Model Y review by
1572,Dogs rock
1573,days after /20 again haha
1574,"Physics favors electric transport, batteries for stationary storage &amp; solar/wind for energy generation"
1575,Major Supercharger increases are underway for the greater LA area
1576,For sure
1577,"Verified should be far more widespread, simply that someone is who they claim to be"
1578,Its a tough one. Thats why we should expand the scope &amp; scale of consciousness to understand the nature of the Universe.
1579,Jay is awesome
1580,Absolutely!
1581,Giga Berlin is gonna rock!
1582,. is a copy haha
1583,Its close though
1584,"This makes no sense for many other reasons too. They dont actually have spectrum priority, they have shared spectrum &amp; nothing about this company is UK, except post office box. Money would be better spent on actual UK satellite industry!"
1585,Glad you like it!
1586,Great idea
1587,"Who controls the memes, controls the Universe"
1588,Literally
1589,Only a matter of time before someone steals a Tesla while playing GTA on a Tesla
1590,"Very meta, but yes"
1591,True
1592,Coming soon
1593,North American Supercharger usage tracking to exceed pre covid highs in to weeks. Lot of noise out there. This is signal.
1594,I think we could make that work
1595,Glad youre ok
1596,"Exactly! A carbon tax is needed to correct the unpriced externality &amp; market will do the rest. The consequences of slow action are serious. In my opinion, we need to convert &gt;80% of the global road, sea &amp; air fleet to renewables by ."
1597,Looks pretty cool
1598,Could be slightly faster
1599,Two Starship tanks in the midbay
1600,Ok
1601,Special thanks to Tesla trucking &amp; rail partners for figuratively &amp; literally going the extra mile
1602,Apologies to Tesla customers for shifting delivery dates. Its a crazy world out there!
1603,"Yes, it is designed to serve the least-served"
1604,"Yes, although Starlink works best for low population density situations"
1605,Canada is a major priority for Starlink!
1606,September sounds about right
1607,Well said by
1608,"Takes longer to get regulatory approvals in Europe, plus way more diverse traffic signs, lights &amp; road rules"
1609,"Timing is uncertain, given externalities, but yes"
1610,Congratulations!
1611,"Very much disagree with this action. In my experience, these skillsets are net job creators. Visa reform makes sense, but this is too broad."
1612,Will be changed to $3k until July st
1613,Yes
1614,Yes
1615,Tentative date for Tesla Shareholder Meeting &amp; Battery Day is Sept . Will include tour of cell production system.
1616,Done. Now $2k via in-app purchase.
1617,Reminder that Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) price goes up by $1k on July st
1618,Enabling basic Tesla Autopilot via Tesla in-app purchase is reduced to $2k until July
1619,All patched up!
1620,"Entirely possible. Social media is a limbic amplifier, which inherently destabilizes civilization."
1621,Ensure future of Earth &amp; extend life sustainably to other planets
1622,Probably early Q4
1623,seems so quaint &amp; long ago
1624,There are no signs of intelligent life
1625,Yes
1626,Luck is the best superpower
1627,That is our purpose
1628,Tesla Bioweapon Defense Mode
1629,We must pass The Great Filter
1630,Thats how she likes it
1631,"Agreed, although best is no out of service stalls"
1632,Mars is my souldog
1633,Yes
1634,"If heat death is the end of the universe, it really is all about the journey"
1635,Best definition of innovation Ive ever heard
1636,All good
1637,Will follow up by tomorrow
1638,Sure
1639,"Will do. I play PC, so missed some of console exclusives."
1640,Haha sure
1641,Deus Ex / Half-Life / Bioshock / Mass Effect / Fallout &amp; New Vegas / Saints Row IV
1642,"There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD"
1643,"This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July . We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July (even if you dont have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good?"
1644,This does sound excessive. Will look into it.
1645,"Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. Its not a good incentive structure."
1646,Haha Teslas all the way down
1647,"Maybe, will look into it. Wed need to emulate a TV."
1648,"We could probably make a fun punch (click) buggy game, with extra points for rare Teslas"
1649,Bought based on your review. Its great!
1650,"The was not to outcompete other companies, but rather to maximize usefulness &amp; rate of progress in the absolute"
1651,"For example, we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer, which is not something car companies do"
1652,"Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies"
1653,We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering &amp; great feedback from Tesla owners in China!
1654,"Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app &amp; overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet"
1655,Feels so long ago
1656,Pulling up to The Petersen
1657,Nice
1658,We will add one more PTO day after the annual review next quarter
1659,It will look a little odd
1660,Probably Fremont
1661,"Probably good to combine them, since they are converging in time. Im hopeful we can announce a date after the July th week."
1662,"Yes, but we will have to postpone annual shareholder meeting, as still no large gatherings allowed by July th. Not sure of new date, but am guessing maybe a month or so later."
1663,Stop by The Petersen is youd like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars &amp; bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.
1664,"It does require use of a paid-time-off day, which is true of many other holidays"
1665,Juneteenth is henceforth considered a US holiday at Tesla &amp; SpaceX
1666,Moving fast
1667,Opening in about two weeks
1668,Reaching chamber pressure of atmospheres
1669,Confirmed
1670,We are considering several options
1671,"Tesla has an option to purchase this land, but has not exercised it"
1672,Renewable energy is happening fast
1673,Comes standard with Cybertruck
1674,Not sure. Theyre pretty close together.
1675,It will be real
1676,Maybe Incat
1677,There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in or years.
1678,We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch &amp; landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.
1679,"Directionally correct, but Zenit is an order of magnitude smaller than Starship system &amp; doesnt come back &amp; land"
1680,"US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology"
1681,Pretty much
1682,Illuminaughty haha
1683,"SpaceX is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for Mars, moon &amp; hypersonic travel around Earth"
1684,Maybe some Flextape
1685,"No problem, we can buff it out"
1686,Fairing reuse is looking good
1687,So where are the aliens?
1688,Or Y
1689,No larger pack Model is in development
1690,"Actually, weve made slight changes, but the range improvement is &gt;90% efficiency"
1691,Cool
1692,Physics doesnt care about politicians
1693,Coming soon
1694,All Model S cars made since late Jan have mile range. This is just making it official.
1695,Tesla Model S now first ever electric vehicle to receive EPA range rating above miles!
1696,Absolutely
1697,China &amp; Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind.
1698,Looking likely
1699,"Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner stiffness, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out."
1700,"Tank didnt burst, but leaked at bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of L stainless being better than . Were developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
1701,"Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas thats already mixed."
1702,Yes
1703,"Thats the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points."
1704,Accurate
1705,Sure
1706,"Around ms. Its designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version , which is at lower altitude could be as low as ms latency."
1707,It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in &amp; point at sky. Can be done in either order.
1708,Congratulations Kathy!
1709,"Acceptable, if your drivetrain is very efficient &amp; you add a little manga"
1710,As foretold by
1711,Stonks
1712,lol
1713,"Exactly. Chartering a dedicated flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once."
1714,True
1715,"Battery industry is world champion at bs. Lithium-ion doesnt really mean anything. What matters is cathode &amp; anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great."
1716,I thought this was an Onion article
1717,Staggeringly dumb
1718,I got the fuel cell question about times
1719,Its getting Biblical
1720,"Exactly, fuel cells = fool sells"
1721,Renewable energy passed coal in April
1722,Worth considering
1723,Agreed
1724,Try Boucher
1725,Great point. Many articles are retweeted based on headlines that dont match the content.
1726,"Actually, were on SN30 for Raptor"
1727,Sure. Thats long montage
1728,Wow
1729,the laser beam long exposure shots
1730,"Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, its % inspiration &amp; % perspiration"
1731,"Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which Id call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka % of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell."
1732,Tesla factory workplace safety is % better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast
1733,"Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2."
1734,"We could never reach Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day &amp; requires desooting of turbines between flights."
1735,After which they are recycled
1736,Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than k miles / k km
1737,"Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories"
1738,"Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission &amp; vehicle production into acount"
1739,"Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets"
1740,Haha. Will post summary.
1741,"Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage"
1742,"Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the s as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to secs."
1743,Wort reading the whole thing
1744,We shall see
1745,Maybe I should retweet the top four or five point. What caught your eye the most?
1746,Good point!
1747,Yes
1748,(Formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative &amp; political bias about almost everything. Reading major newspapers makes you feel sad &amp; angry. Thats why theyre being crushed by . Likes/retweets of old media are extremely low. Ironic article:
1749,Size matters
1750,Sure seems that way
1751,Bad incentive structure
1752,To meme the impossible meme
1753,Were working on new legs. Wider stance &amp; able to auto-level. Important for leaning into wind or landing on rocky &amp; pitted surfaces.
1754,"Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha."
1755,Absolutely
1756,"Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible."
1757,"Wow, this is extremely important!!"
1758,"Autopilot prime directive is: dont crash. What seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. degree low light vision &amp; sonar, plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. Upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential."
1759,Stankonia at
1760,Good point
1761,And those who werent expecting a ternary joke
1762,Mars has an amazing amount of water ice
1763,m
1764,Yeah. Even stacking on the pad will be quite an adventure!
1765,Creating the production system is &gt;1000% harder than building one rocket. This is the truly hard thing.
1766,Its insane
1767,Pursuing all three. Hard to say right now.
1768,Gateway to Mars
1769,Lot has happened since then!

1776,What a cute &amp; happy dog!
1777,Big line at the barbershop
1778,Thursday
1779,I guess more people need to get more involved in the party primaries (which is a chore)
1780,The gerontocracy is out of touch with the people
1781,"Selling weed literally went from major felony to essential business (open during pandemic) in much of America &amp; yet many are still in prison. Doesnt make sense, isnt right."
1782,"This will probably get me into trouble, but I feel I have to say it"
1783,Good point haha
1784,Order a Tesla online in mins at
1785,Tesla Model Y review by Dan Neil
1786,Methalox is the right propellant. Should be staged combustion &amp; highly reusable.
1787,Yes
1788,"About a dozen transfer windows, so ~25 years"
1789,"Wow, hard to believe that was years ago!"
1790,Jack is doing his best. I support him.
1791,Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!
1792,This is insane
1793,Thats when all life on Earth will be boiled off. What matters is how long civilization is capable of making the jump to Mars. This could be a very short period of time measured in decades. It took billion years to get to this point &amp; civilization isnt looking super stable.
1794,"So many war stories over eventful years! But Starship can make life multiplanetary, which is what really matters for safeguarding the light of consciousness &amp; life as we know it. X improvement over Falcon/Dragon."
1795,Off Twitter for a while
1796,Starship is the key to making life multiplanetary &amp; protecting the light of consciousness
1797,Well said
1798,Definitely not right that the other officers were charged with nothing. What message does this send in general to officers who stand by while another does wrong?
1799,Wheres the banana!?
1800,Nine years later
1801,Must be due to relativistic aging

1811,"Proceeding with countdown today, weather cancellation risk ~50%"
1812,Yes
1813,"Worth noting that, as of Jan , Tesla buyers no longer received any federal tax credit. Model led despite this disadvantage."
1814,"We slowed down a bit to allow Supercharger V3 production to get going, but now will speed up!"
1815,More Superchargers coming soon!

1823,Dragon Dawn
1824,Thanks Lex!
1825,Good question

1831,Fallout New Omaha
1832,"His ideas sound sensible, but he was not my or SpaceXs brain coach. I think he maybe gave a talk once."
1833,years ago. We need to accelerate progress towards fully reusable rockets. Cost per ton to orbit needs to improve by &gt;1000% from where Falcon is today for there to be a self-sustaining city on Mars.
1834,Mars needs to happen soon
1835,Made on Earth by humans
1836,Cool
1837,Pretty much
1838,"Reviewed design with Franz last night. Even % smaller is too small. Will be pretty much this size. Well probably do a smaller, tight world truck at some point."
1839,Haha true! Hard to convey tone in tweets. Many people would probably be a lot less upset if they heard me speak the words.
1840,Astronauts to orbit in days!!

1842,The medium is the message
1843,Time to return
1844,New New Hampshire license plate?
1845,"Open your eyes, look up to the skies"
1846,Great episode
1847,Sure
1848,Jay *really* knows cars! Next-level.
1849,Im a big fan of Kathy Lueders!
1850,Mission control at the Cape
1851,Much harder problem than it may seem
1852,"Culmination of a truly incredible amount of work by &amp; engineering, along with support of all International countries"
1853,Sure
1854,Cool group
1855,Astronauts to orbit next week!
1856,True
1857,I am openly moderate
1858,"More fun, less shun!"
1859,Exactly
1860,Cancel Cancel Culture!
1861,Yes
1862,"The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval. It that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000."
1863,Tesla Full Self-Driving option cost rises by ~$1000 worldwide on July st. Order a Tesla online in less than minutes at
1864,Zach made a significant contribution to SpaceX &amp; is a friend. I wish him well as he tries something new.
1865,"Great. Just sleeps &amp; eats, overall pretty chill."
1866,Maybe today if were lucky
1867,One of my fav Matrix memes
1868,When u take DayQuil &amp; NyQuil at same time
1869,Take the red pill
1870,"Pretty good, how are you?"
1871,No problem
1872,I still only own Bitcoins btw
1873,"Pretty much, although massive currency issuance by govt central banks is making Bitcoin Internet money look solid by comparison"
1874,Pretty much
1875,"Frankly, I dont even know what plethora means"
1876,True
1877,"Agreed, people have forgotten how much in-person events matter! Also, theres a lot to see. Its not just a presentation."
1878,Making great candy is harder than it seems!
1879,Maximize the freedom of action of the people
1880,True
1881,Great wiki piece!
1882,"Napoleon was incredible. It is my wish that my ashes may repose on the banks of the Seine, in the midst of the French people, whom I have loved so well."
1883,The Age of Napoleon by Will &amp; Ariel Durant is an amazing book
1884,A few weeks away
1885,Totally. Collective mind control by stoking fear.
1886,Marx vs Adam Smith -&gt; Adam Smith for the win. Not even close.
1887,"Yes, improvement is exponential"
1888,Yeah. Maybe following individual journalists &amp; citizen journalists is better than publications. The Onion may be the best mainstream media source. Hard to figure out whats actually going on in the world!
1889,Its remarkable how often The News attempts to answer the question: what is the worst thing that happened on Earth today?
1890,Still am
1891,More or less crazy than reality itself?
1892,Its next-level for sure. Reality is getting weird fast.
1893,Famous last words
1894,"I said run for office, not president (sigh). Who even owns Newsweek these days? I lost track."
1895,Boring Co will also connect Vegas hotels &amp; airport. Autonomous Teslas in tunnels will provide individualized mass transit.
1896,Were going to have to push out the date or attendance will be very low. Maybe do in two parts: webcast next month &amp; in-person event a few months later?
1897,Hospitals are going bankrupt for lack of patients
1898,True (sigh)
1899,"Seriously, Big Candy is suppressing R&amp! Whens the last time you heard of a great new candy bar?"
1900,He was critical of large bureaucracies &amp; Napoleon III was indeed a knucklehead
1901,"Fair point, PyTorch is great!"
1902,Capitalism already has many fetters in the form of a plethora of regulatory bodies! Im definitely against any monopolies/oligopolies where there is a low forcing function for improving customer happiness or an unpriced externality that consumes a common good (eg emissions).
1903,Probably sooner
1904,This is happening a lot
1905,That would be cool!
1906,Very much agree!
1907,Along with several guillotine death threats!
1908,Boring Company completes nd Vegas tunnel
1909,"In his th Brumaire essay (in which he does make some good points), Marx famously said history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. This is now ironically happening with Marxism."
1910,Exactly
1911,Tesla makes the safest cars in the world &amp; our factory injury rate is better than industry avg &amp; tracking to be better than any auto plant in North America. We care deeply about safety at a fundamental level.
1912,"SpaceX has employees in California, Washington, Texas &amp; Florida. Operating this entire time, as we have national security exemption. Zero deaths or serious illnesses."
1913,Absolutely. Tesla already went through this in China with employees. Zero fatalities or serious illnesses.
1914,"The statistics stopped being valid when anyone with covid symptoms, which is now almost anything, was counted as having covid"
1915,"Well said! Please run for office. The politicians &amp; unelected bureaucrats who stole our liberty should be tarred, feathered &amp; thrown out of town!"
1916,Exactly
1917,Yes
1918,Exactly
1919,Thanks for adding!
1920,Tesla Supercharger usage by region
1921,Top Marx
1922,Facebook sucks
1923,Fair point
1924,Super exciting day coming up!
1925,The custom styling some of the team is doing over their masks is really cool!
1926,Exactly!
1927,"Said another way, Falcon Heavy has /3 thrust of Saturn V. Starship/Super Heavy will have double thrust of Saturn V."
1928,"Power of F9 today is still not widely understood. It has about same thrust as Delta IV Heavy, most powerful Boeing/Lockheed rocket. Falcon Heavy has triple."
1929,Yes
1930,Cost-plus contracting is the devil
1931,"Hi Jared, Colorado is great! I think your policies make a lot of sense."
1932,Life should be lived
1933,Buca
1934,Tolkien rocks
1935,For sure
1936,Best group on FB by far
1937,"Personally, I think we should"
1938,"This is getting annoying. Honestly, Im not sure its even helping their scam!"
1939,"Those who always disagree have a closed mind but, by their very nature, that wont sink in (sigh)"
1940,Its not often that the Governor of California &amp; the President agree!
1941,Thank you!
1942,It appears that what he is saying is untrue
1943,Lil baby
1944,Great
1945,Tough call. Maybe Newton by a small margin. Both obviously extremely smart for a human.
1946,"Wow, great writing!"
1947,"All other car companies are allowed to manufacture *except* Tesla, you knucklehead. No wonder you got crushed by a computer the size of a pizza box."
1948,Much appreciated!
1949,Thats pretty much what happened
1950,Pretty close. It will look absurdly tall &amp; have a lot more ground support equipment.
1951,Haggerty actually admitted to NYT that he told his staff to slow down Tesla for reasons that had nothing to do with health. Unreal
1952,Exactly
1953,Exactly
1954,"Dont mislead the public. State said YES, an unelected county official is the problem. Tesla factory in adjacent San Joaquin county is fully operational."
1955,"Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me."
1956,"Yes, California approved, but an unelected county official illegally overrode. Also, all other auto companies in US are approved to resume. Only Tesla has been singled out. This is super messed up!"
1957,Thank you Governor Newsom!
1958,Zork with AI dungeon master
1959,Note is much appreciated
1960,Interesting
1961,"Yes, this is insane"
1962,Babies rock
1963,Good summary
1964,Yes
1965,That would be great
1966,We should do this
1967,Thanks for the cool suggestions More fun coming to your Tesla soon!
1968,For real
1969,Absolutely
1970,Happy Mothers Day to other mothers!!
1971,"No, I just think youre a boring idiot"
1972,Message received
1973,This thread summarizes situation perfectly
1974,Sheriff Bianco rocks!
1975,They were amazing
1976,"Absolutely. Moreover, they dont even need to be tested for covid, just need covid-like symptoms, which is a long list, including feeling weakness. Hard to die *without* feeling weakness!"
1977,Georgia lifted lockdown days ago
1978,He is right
1979,We are a pattern of atoms
1980,Pretty much
1981,Exactly
1982,SN4 passed high pressure (7.5 bar) &amp; engine thrust load at cryo
1983,q t
1984,u Mom
1985,Meant to say
1986,Sorry
1987,"Im not messing around. Absurd &amp; medically irrational behavior in violation of constitutional civil liberties, moreover by *unelected* county officials with no accountability, needs to stop."
1988,"Much appreciated, Mayor Fine!"
1989,Thanks Mayor Mei!
1990,Absolutely
1991,Please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with
1992,"Yes, already done"
1993,Yes
1994,Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California &amp; second biggest exporter
1995,Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
1996,"Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county."
1997,"San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working /7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada."
1998,"Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA."
1999,"Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant Interim Health Officer of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!"
2000,"No, I have a license!"
2001,B-nut
2002,"Half a , philosophically, must ipso facto half not"
2003,Turns out hobbits are enormous
2004,"Once again, I must recommend"
2005,Glad we could help
2006,Its true
2007,Coming soon
2008,"Yes, this is a high priority"
2009,"Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching %"
2010,"Pain can certainly be turned off, but were not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet"
2011,Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
2012,Thats harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
2013,Ok
2014,"No, but its mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs )"
2015,"Its not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal."
2016,"To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs."
2017,"Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)"
2018,Would be about times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
2019,"Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is tons (78% O2 &amp; % CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for tons to orbit or ~$10/kg."
2020,"Thats pretty much what happened. The cows werent sure what to do (not having encountered a rocket before), so first ran one direction, then the other."
2021,A mandatory tracing app would be insane
2022,True
2023,Probably makes sense to have a Details section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
2024,Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes
2025,Would cover latitude of London
2026,Yes
2027,"Peak rate of about half that for version is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under ms."
2028,"It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator"
2029,Sure
2030,Way more important than it sounds
2031,Yeah!!
2032,"A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc."
2033,SLS makes me feel sad
2034,"No, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded"
2035,"Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine"
2036,A great mystery of the universe
2037,Its so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
2038,"Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!"
2039,"Looks about right. Ice mining/refining on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life."
2040,"In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid"
2041,"Yes, converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars!"
2042,"Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks well be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack."
2043,Turns on city street intersections is the big one
2044,Yes. Static fire feeding from fuel header vs main tank.
2045,Not SpaceX
2046,His son sounds great btw
2047,was a super tough year on all levels
2048,"Tesla &amp; SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! Thats why."
2049,Good for them! About half the US will be mostly open by this weekend.
2050,Yes
2051,That was the whole company back then. Grew organically from a simple mariachi party in El Segundo.
2052,U r a powerful
2053,Wishing good vibes for all in nd half
2054,"I mean, this does seem like a time for Dad jokes"
2055,Orange you glad its not entomology?
2056,"Yeah, but stopped doing physically risky things after the kids were born"
2057,Archangel-12
2058,"SR-71, but yes"
2059,Not to mention !
2060,Thanks Maria
2061,Possibly even flatter!
2062,Hopefully so
2063,Whats wild is that Super Heavy will have Raptor engines in same space!
2064,"Its true, the pressure bulkheads are too pointy"
2065,Starship SN4 passed static fire
2066,"Happy, healthy &amp; cute as a button"
2067,This person is wrong. Why does JD want to believe he got cucked so bad anyway!?
2068,There would be time-stamped video if this were true
2069,Should be a lot of fun!
2070,There are many pieces to the puzzle
2071,DKE in a nutshell: were almost always dumber than we think we are
2072,"Science is simply rigorous pursuit of truth. Quality of reasoning is all that matters, which means a ten-year-old could be more correct than a physics Nobel Prize winner."
2073,That would be awesome
2074,"This is false. JDs team put out video evidence, but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD &amp; AH had separated."
2075,"Yeah, definitely a future feature"
2076,Levitt rocks
2077,"Important to distinguish died with covid vs died because of covid. Also, distinguish between tested positive for covid or only had symptoms."
2078,Utter moron
2079,Thanks! Something more should be done. This guy has caused massive strife to the world with his absurdly fake science.
2080,What a tool
2081,Nope. Thanks!
2082,Thanks Never too young for some ink haha
2083,Boy
2084,X A-12 Musk
2085,Mom &amp; baby all good
2086,A few hours away!
2087,"Anyway, were just talking about % here, so not much. Confident Model S will get + miles as soon as retest is allowed."
2088,Weird that EPA would deny this. We have precise car logs that confirm it happened. Happy to provide them.
2089,I hope anything lands
2090,It seems unlikely right now
2091,Mostly accurate. Liquid CH4 temp got too high this time. Offloading propellant. Will we retry later today.
2092,Thanks!
2093,Commentary is quite entertaining! MST3K
2094,SN4 soon. Raptor looks so sml.
2095,Good chance it accelerates viral vaccines &amp; cures
2096,True
2097,Whats troubling is that this doesnt get humanity a base on the moon or even a small crewed Mars mission
2098,"Excuse me, thats Mr. Bizznizz . Wheres the respek!?"
2099,There are many silver linings &amp; that is one
2100,Exactly
2101,"Who is running this lame collection of bots &amp; trolls anyway? Try harder! Im an engineer, knucklehead. Just do business on the side."
2102,Online
2103,"Well said, Lord Sumption, well said!"
2104,"Ok, we will"
2105,"Yes, about a month away from testing Raptor Vacuum"
2106,"A little. Will have engines, not , no big fins and legs similar to ship. That thrust dome is the super hard part. Raptor SL thrust starts at ton, but upgrades in the works for ton."
2107,Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokmon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?
2108,Minecraft has amazing legs
2109,That was years ago &amp; still not even on the moon. Progress must accelerate!
2110,Pretty much
2111,What excites you about ?
2112,I dont want to set the world on fire by the Ink Spots
2113,One of the all-time best songs
2114,"Rocket Rd, Hawthorne CA"
2115,"Sure, thanks"
2116,Very much so
2117,Pretty much
2118,Freedom
2119,Are we still free? Are we still brave? Hell yeah!!
2120,Exactly
2121,Even would agree
2122,Hopefully in a few days
2123,Haha
2124,Were going to try landing Starship on the moon with enough propellant to return to Earth
2125,How much for some anime Bitcoin?
2126,Reality is its own parrot parody
2127,There will be no Mars if we let them take our freedom away
2128,bring it on
2129,"As always, I am optimistic about Tesla long-term"
2130,Baby due on Monday
2131,Dont need the cash. Devoting myself to Mars and Earth. Possession just weigh you down.
2132,My gf is mad at me
2133,Just one stipulation on sale: I own Gene Wilders old house. It cannot be torn down or lose any its soul.
2134,"Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness"
2135,Exactly. How cheaply freedom is sold.
2136,O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
2137,"Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave"
2138,Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
2139,"And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air"
2140,Now give people back their FREEDOM
2141,Tesla stock price is too high imo
2142,I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house.
2143,Incentives matter
2144,Starship is making good progress
2145,What is real any more
2146,You got it!
2147,Exactly
2148,Well said
2149,This needs to stop
2150,AI makes more progress
2151,This is misleading to the public
2152,Classifying all deaths as corona even if corona didnt cause the death is simply a lie
2153,Great work by SpaceX team &amp; very much appreciate faith in Starship by !
2154,You dont say
2155,Sound reasoning
2156,Yup
2157,Sweden is sensible
2158,Exactly
2159,Why forced isolation is bad
2160,California HHS server crashed. Maybe it has covid.
2161,Yes!
2162,Actual data reference CHHS
2163,Hospitals in California have been half empty this whole time
2164,Bravo !
2165,Very sensible
2166,Yes
2167,Bon voyage
2168,Hell yeah!!
2169,True
2170,"Yes, reopen with care &amp; appropriate protection, but dont put everyone under de facto house arrest"
2171,FREE AMERICA NOW
2172,Bravo Texas!
2173,Give people their freedom back!
2174,Which isnt easy!
2175,Too much the moral arbiter of the world
2176,Silicon Valley has become Sanctimonious Valley
2177,Starship will be able to launch telescopes over X diameter of Hubble
2178,Hopefully start serving Africa early next year
2179,Pretty much
2180,"Soon, it will be in tiktok"
2181,Oddly mesmerizing
2182,"Haha true. Great headline. Its quite hard to have rocket test articles not explode, as they so desperately want to!"
2183,Interesting
2184,Yes
2185,Just one. SN5 will get three.
2186,Static fire with Raptor hopefully later this week
2187,"bar. Kind of a softball tbh, but thats enough to fly!"
2188,Great work by SpaceX engineering!
2189,SN4 passed cryo proof!
2190,What do you make of the FT claims?
2191,"FT is saying current death rate is extremely unusual, but youre saying was higher. Which is correct?"
2192,Snowing in Texas
2193,Cryo test underway
2194,Dark mode makes Twitter feel like night
2195,How is it considered probable if theres no covid test? Is just a cough or high temperature enough?
2196,So dark out there
2197,Would be helpful to distinguish deaths caused by covid vs unrelated to covid!
2198,True
2199,. may be but his tweets are
2200,Interesting
2201,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
2202,Docs make good points
2203,"Yes, switching soon to a series alloy with higher ductility at cryogenic temp. is good as sheet, but not as plate. Also, a lot of geometric changes."
2204,Not yet
2205,Successive iteration of both design &amp; manufacturing. Latter is % harder than former.
2206,Its a little dicey tbh. Thrust dome is being redesigned. Current one has four separate layers of steel in some places!
2207,m
2208,Physically ready in a few weeks. Approvals may take longer.
2209,Aiming for cryo pressure test tonight
2210,SN4 passed ambient pressure test
2211,Romance Mode
2212,Dogecoin Mode
2213,Great
2214,Heard same from doc I trust
2215,"No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad"
2216,That basically describes SoC vs SoC of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
2217,So often true
2218,Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
2219,These wont be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.
2220,Great labeling tools &amp; talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated.
2221,"As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it"
2222,Its also because of the Spitfire engine &amp; wizard
2223,Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a % to % higher safety requirement long-term.
2224,Progress is good
2225,Definitely
2226,Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation.
2227,"Sure, we can probably do an update later this year"
2228,Needs to be more than halfway to east coast
2229,"Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity"
2230,Yes
2231,Yes
2232,I agree
2233,Mythic Quest is MTTD
2234,Mean Time To Dick is a key measure of any given human or machine intelligence system
2235,Merlin is very simple compared to Raptor
2236,Width currently limited by size of cold-roll press needed to get steel to full hard condition. Bigger press will be built long-term.
2237,Absolutely
2238,Great questions from Hack Club!
2239,Thats hardcore
2240,The Machine Stops
2241,Hard to imagine
2242,Seems so long ago
2243,Exactly
2244,Its great
2245,Welcome to the Tesla board! Honored to have you.
2246,Starship SN4 tank on test stand
2247,"Yes, same results are showing up pretty much everywhere on Earth. Contagion is higher in high pop density cities &amp; mortality proportionate to age."
2248,Silver lining is that mortality rate is much lower than predicted &amp; herd immunity much higher. Good news.
2249,Maybe Cybertruck will have it
2250,"Im dying to do super efficient, quiet home HVAC with HEPA &amp; water distillation. Its weird, but I really want to do it."
2251,Good one
2252,Will talk with team. We have a lot on our plate!
2253,"Side camera view looks a little weird, as meant for self-driving, but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing."
2254,"That is more reasonable, especially if mostly loans. Oil &amp; gas is an important industry without which civilization could not function at this time, but financial support should be proportionate to rest of economy."
2255,So shall we all
2256,Yes
2257,Haha sure
2258,Good summary
2259,Coming soon
2260,Yes
2261,Yes
2262,"Yeah, its named after my friend Joe who suggested the feature"
2263,Maybe just make Joe Mode quieter?
2264,"Private beta begins in ~3 months, public beta in ~6 months, starting with high latitudes"
2265,"In advance of this, please try to hack Starlink &amp; Tesla Mothership!"
2266,There are now operational Starlink satellites
2267,New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan
2268,"Pretty much. We place high value on simulation too, but nothings as weird as reality!"
2269,"Its made of a special dark foam thats extremely radio transparent, so as not to affect the phased array antennas. Looks a lot like a car sun visor."
2270,Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. Were fixing it now.
2271,Yes
2272,They are in fact being deorbited haha
2273,Small amount of isopropyl alcohol (cleaning fluid) was trapped in a sensor dead leg &amp; ignited in flight
2274,Sure hope so!
2275,"Frankly, much of the stimulus money is questionable, but this much to oil &amp; gas seems especially so"
2276,Not the greatest use of money
2277,"If this launch succeeds, we will have put up satellites"
2278,Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch .
2279,Makes sense
2280,Nice
2281,Anything surprising?
2282,Numbers I was told from Wuhan were % to % mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.
2283,"When I talked to doctors in Wuhan, they recommended against invasive ventilators &amp; in favor of non-invasive"
2284,No kidding
2285,Good article
2286,"Am in Boca working on the rocket with an awesome team, so pretty great"
2287,"Definitely header tanks &amp; nosecone on SN5, hopefully flaps too. Definitely flaps on SN6"
2288,Crazy times!
2289,Red sky of Mars is Blue at dawn &amp; dusk
2290,Check the warranty
2291,Guaranteed to make any party more fun!
2292,Thanks everyone! Still cant believe I was born days after /20
2293,Yes. It will even float for a while.
2294,"Yeah, and whole lot more! Aargh, Im dying to make Cybertruck like yesterday!!"
2295,Thinking about this
2296,This is the key paragraph
2297,Pretty much
2298,Mechanically attached to steel studs. Insulation is certainly the intention!
2299,Best political platform ever
2300,"SpaceX has a lot of experience berthing &amp; now docking with , which is very difficult. Orbital refilling should in theory be easier, since Starships dock with themselves &amp; will be uncrewed at first."
2301,Great platform
2302,"Fully reusable orbital rocket, then orbital refilling, then Mars"
2303,% would be impressive. Anything below a % payload hit would be outstanding.
2304,"I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasnt just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind."
2305,"Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter."
2306,Maybe % change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
2307,Probably to months
2308,"Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as ventilator, but makes many good points"
2309,Youd think theyd at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. Its very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are real ventilators.
2310,My kids loved that one when they were little
2311,Congratulations again! Starfleet begins
2312,The way it should be!
2313,Youre welcome! Very exciting times ahead for space.
2314,"Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests, as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them, there are about engine stands operating in parallel."
2315,"No, as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs tons). Only uses very tip of the nose."
2316,SN5
2317,"No, oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry"
2318,"Similar, but seemingly small changes can have surprisingly big effects"
2319,Should be available as an in app purchase next month
2320,"Youre right, will fix"
2321,"Good point. Yeah, Remdesivir is sounding very promising!"
2322,Orbital human spaceflight returns to the Cape in six weeks!
2323,Advertising salespeople dressed as truth tellers
2324,"Trying have fewer parts, so strakes are unlikely. Some very counterintuitive CFD results in both hypersonic &amp; subsonic regimes. Starship does controlled falling more than flying."
2325,"Flaps, actuator &amp; static aero are undergoing redesign for mass reduction &amp; simplicity"
2326,Will do
2327,True
2328,Exactly
2329,"Good progress, but years to launch our first humans is a long time. Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime."
2330,"Pretty much, although we also sent some Medtronic units, which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up &amp; operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system."
2331,"Its a hard problem, mostly due to esthetics, but its the future we should have"
2332,Reviewing overall system with vehicle engineering team next week. Should have number then.
2333,"Reduced size by ~3%, center line is more level &amp; lower window sill height"
2334,All new
2335,"It is about % too small, but lots of fun"
2336,Were working on increasing dynamic air suspension travel for better off-roading. Needs to kick butt in Baja.
2337,Karma is real
2338,"Yeah, super messed up"
2339,"These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment"
2340,Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators
2341,Perhaps you are unaware that Twitter has a search function? The hospitals *themselves* acknowledged receipt of ventilators.
2342,Nice
2343,All
2344,Interesting
2345,So true
2346,"Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help!"
2347,I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb.
2348,. please fix this misunderstanding
2349,Exactly
2350,What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
2351,Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning. Yup.
2352,Dont jump to intubation. Dr Caputo
2353,"A mask or nose ventilator with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; youre fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable."
2354,Sounds about right
2355,Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? Im hearing % to %. Is this overly pessimistic?
2356,"I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington"
2357,Were working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
2358,"They were, but are they currently?"
2359,Interesting
2360,"We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, % empty."
2361,Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
2362,Sure
2363,"Production is by *far* the hard part. Thats why Im not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, theyre pretty sweet"
2364,"SN4 wont get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps."
2365,Thats for sure!
2366,I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! Its very hard. Im spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done
2367,My (again) personal favorite is
2368,"Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially . Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesnt scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, its probably right move for small LEO vehicle."
2369,"Vast majority of ventilators are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patients throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2."
2370,SN26
2371,"Merlin is arguably version or by now. Its a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!"
2372,"The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!"
2373,"Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch"
2374,"Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US."
2375,"Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage."
2376,"Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet %."
2377,"Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!"
2378,"Exactly. In mid , Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late . First actual disbursement was Q2 , long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
2379,"Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."
2380,"Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon mission. Thats the acid test."
2381,"True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, theyd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying."
2382,"To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but its hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop"
2383,Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
2384,You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
2385,"Theres tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!"
2386,"Giga Berlin will have worlds most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature"
2387,This will happen
2388,We stole that from cheetahs
2389,"In case its not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs"
2390,"Theres a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&amp;A."
2391,"Just battery day, but it will be great. Plaid powertrain will be later this year."
2392,"While others party, he study the blade"
2393,DayQuil or NyQuil?
2394,Happy Easter! Follow the
2395,Yes
2396,Functionality still looking good for this year. Regulatory approval is the big unknown.
2397,"Its not turned on. Meant for vandalism monitoring in a robotaxi future. Also, the car has transparent windows, so spying has limited value."
2398,Turns out that gun is for the toilet paper
2399,Correct
2400,"Yes, this is a real problem. The science is not in doubt."
2401,Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize
2402,"In the future, it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable."
2403,The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea:
2404,"Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible."
2405,A lot has happened in years
2406,Good talking to you too. It was an honor.
2407,"SpaceX rockets are % reusable, theirs are %. This is the actual problem."
2408,Tragedy
2409,"Tunnels arent required for this, but might be the only realistic way to solve for downtown to downtown travel"
2410,But actually
2411,"The Standard Model is amazing for useful predictions. Truly amazing. Dark * seems sketch, but doesnt appear to matter to our immediate future."
2412,is bs
2413,String theory
2414,Theres a bit more to it than that
2415,Youre welcome!
2416,All input is error. When is the fan speed wrong?
2417,Plaid Cybertruck is what I will drive
2418,Im not sure whether that number is lucky or unlucky
2419,Hard to predict dates right now. Most likely postponed to mid May.
2420,In about a year. Would come from Giga Berlin.
2421,You may return the vehicle for a full refund in the unlikely event that it causes domestic discord
2422,Essentially
2423,Good one
2424,What is simple in one arena is often profound in another
2425,Ok
2426,Great differences in technology exist in the world about which even hardcore technologists are unaware
2427,AddLabel -&gt; PersonDressedAsCone
2428,Certainly no problem for a trillion operations per second computer to make ~15 steering/acceleration/braking maneuvers per second. Thats a trillion calculations between each output command.
2429,"Humans drive using cameras on a slow gimbal &amp; are often distracted. A Tesla with cameras, radar, sonar &amp; always being alert can definitely be superhuman."
2430,Cool
2431,Aim for zero velocity just above surface &amp; fall. You wont fall fast.
2432,Fine by me
2433,The th &amp; final Dragon mission is complete
2434,Ok
2435,Coming soon
2436,Definitely
2437,"Probably best to keep control local, but easy to check status from afar"
2438,High pucker-factor landing
2439,Here you go
2440,Puts our basic instincts on a roller coaster
2441,Twitter causes id sinuation
2442,Thats our goal!
2443,This is awesome!
2444,Starship fuel header tank
2445,Like tears in rain
2446,Ok
2447,Amazing
2448,Music is a limbic resonator
2449,Nice ink
2450,"Not a question of wanting to do it or not, but rather having anyone there to make sure it gets delivered &amp; works"
2451,Not true
2452,Cool!
2453,Love that Gen Shinseki quote!
2454,Nice color
2455,Lovable dog . Mine looks like yours but in black &amp; white.
2456,True. Each of these engines is also slightly different. Raptor is evolving rapidly.
2457,"It is stable on the ground without propellant loaded, which is an improvement from OG Atlas"
2458,Shes neither here nor there
2459,Beatrix Potter energy!
2460,One is Havanese &amp; one came from the pound
2461,"Hard to tell scale, as body diameter is m or ~30 ft, but it looks like it could be R2D2 size in this video"
2462,So proud
2463,Raptors
2464,"Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, were going to reuse much of the thrust section."
2465,"Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe."
2466,"Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo."
2467,There are redundant pressure control valves. Its a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
2468,"If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, youre doomed anyway, so might as well go all in"
2469,Were adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
2470,"Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2."
2471,Press any key to continue
2472,Youre welcome!
2473,u r o k
2474,Tesla is on second rev of internal ventilator design. Will post an update on this tomorrow.
2475,"Yeah, about $35k with shipping &amp; taxes"
2476,"Bought, but SpaceX is spooling up to manufacture proportional solenoid valves for Medtronic (confirmed as critical today with chair &amp; CEO)"
2477,First Medtronic units from Tesla getting installed in NY metro area. These are for worst case situations.
2478,Were going to simplify Plaid a little. Was getting too complex.
2479,"Oh sure, good point. Will discuss with team &amp; make available to buy in Tesla app."
2480,Some progress
2481,"Yeah, probably July st"
2482,Hoping to roll out traffic lights &amp; stops to wide US release in a few weeks &amp; probably WW release in Q3 (so many variations in each country!). Very important to make sure this is done right.
2483,"Homelink is rd party hardware that increases cost of all cars, but only some people use it, so its only installed upon request. Long-term, garage openers are transitioning to WiFi-activated."
2484,Monty Python &amp; Mel Brooks are my all-time favorites
2485,Northwell seems to be very pragmatic &amp; sensible. Impressive work in difficult circumstances.
2486,And how to tell if someones a witch
2487,So many brilliant scenes. Anarcho-syndicalism!
2488,"We will see what data review says in the morning, but this may have been a test configuration mistake"
2489,Its true
2490,Air quality has a much bigger effect on health than people realize. Credit to Larry Page for making me aware of this.
2491,Some valves leaked at cryo temp. Fixing &amp; will retest soon.
2492,High quality critical feedback from Munro &amp; Co is much appreciated!
2493,Sounds promising. Will be interesting to see results of clinical trials.
2494,For those who care about details
2495,Youre most welcome! Impressive work by Mount Sinai team.
2496,"SN3 passed ambient temperature pressure test last night, now doing cryogenic"
2497,Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder whos behind it.
2498,"Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low."
2499,"Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight."
2500,"Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical."
2501,Will call when we reach Mars
2502,Exactly
2503,Definitely need a wider span
2504,Yeah
2505,"Yes, v close! Nice work. Those are V0.9 legs, so major upgrades coming. Need wider span, longer stroke &amp; ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds."
2506,Interesting
2507,"Y has next-level upgrades, especially body castings &amp; heat pump"
2508,Happy we could be helpful! More available if needed.
2509,"Mass of initial SN ships will be a little high &amp; Isp a little low, but, over time, it will be ~150t to LEO fully reusable"
2510,"We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device &amp; shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or know."
2511,"The legs extend &amp; telescope out, so are longer than they seem, but not as long as they will be for SN4+"
2512,One day we will
2513,The S-curve appears to be entering the logarithmic phase
2514,Ok
2515,"Hopefully, Starship will have enough flight history to substitute for Dragon for NASA missions too"
2516,Now on launch stand
2517,Seeing friends
2518,Hello from the Inside
2519,Logarithm graphs coming soon
2520,Magnetic personality
2521,"And many doctors are not treating patients, due to fear of giving or receiving C19"
2522,This sounds great
2523,Can you do a fast antibody test?
2524,Yes
2525,"Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if youre immune. Refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind."
2526,Buzzfeed is a mind virus
2527,Also makes for a great shelter
2528,"We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them"
2529,"Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed."
2530,"Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when theyre needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues."
2531,Youre most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.
2532,Dragonfire
2533,Exactly. Douglas Adams knew what he was talking about.
2534,Stop! In the name of love
2535,Yes
2536,. Care to comment?
2537,"Working on that with Medtronic. Given NY pressing needs, were delivering Resmed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight."
2538,Sigh
2539,Yes
2540,"Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation"
2541,SN3
2542,Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
2543,Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include estimated illness onset date. This is a significantly less rigorous standard.
2544,C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
2545,Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
2546,Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
2547,This meme proves it
2548,Its ducked!
2549,. pls fix awetoekreqt
2550,"True. , this is accurate. You believe in journalistic integrity, but if something isnt done, this will continue."
2551,Have let know
2552,This is messed up
2553,Both
2554,"Could maybe tap the condensation for water too. Seems odd that HVAC systems make pure, fresh water &amp; just dump it on the ground."
2555,"Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly"
2556,"Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!"
2557,"Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when youre expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy."
2558,This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
2559,"Sure would love to do home hvac thats quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter"
2560,Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast &amp; extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.
2561,The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
2562,Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering Ive seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
2563,Will do
2564,"Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:"
2565,Exactly
2566,"According to the Italian govt, only % of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries."
2567,Engineering ftw
2568,Much appreciated
2569,Have you seen more data on HCQ &amp; Z-Pak? Hard to find.
2570,Worrisome
2571,Yup
2572,Well try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
2573,Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
2574,Nice
2575,This is great advice
2576,Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if theres anything else you need.
2577,"We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part."
2578,Supply chain logistics getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time is the main issue were hearing from ER physicians
2579,Youre most welcome. Were working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
2580,Panic is always dumb
2581,"Italy: On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus."
2582,"Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors"
2583,We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
2584,Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
2585,No problem
2586,"Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China."
2587,"Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world"
2588,Fair point
2589,"Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too."
2590,Up to % false positive
2591,"Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."
2592,Do you have data on the false positive rate? Ive heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and presumed positive.
2593,Important consideration
2594,Feels like the plot of Deus Ex
2595,"A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk"
2596,"Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too"
2597,"That wont work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory cant stay open"
2598,"Yes, were working on ventilators, even though I think they probably wont be needed"
2599,Interesting thread
2600,Thanks
2601,China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
2602,"Were working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter"
2603,"Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important."
2604,"Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky."
2605,"Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April"
2606,Yes
2607,No new domestic corona cases in China
2608,"Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was %, %, %. Track this chart:"
2609,"Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs"
2610,Yes
2611,True
2612,"Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasnt happened already."
2613,"Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?"
2614,We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
2615,Some helpful data from Italy
2616,"Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New confirmed cases, not oft-reported presumptive positive is trending to level off over next few weeks &amp; be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China."
2617,% chance of anything close
2618,How does this compare to favipiravir?
2619,"Yeah, that will be a great milestone"
2620,"Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly, but not obviously, related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isnt a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Wont risk non-SpaceX satellites."
2621,"Yeah, most reflights ever!"
2622,"Yeah. There was also an early engine shutdown on ascent, but it didnt affect orbit insertion. Shows value of having engines! Thorough investigation needed before next mission."
2623,Because polygon doesnt rhyme
2624,Yeah
2625,Awe tow co wrecked
2626,Abysmal autocorrect might be the reason people dont fear AI
2627,Fear the memesphere
2628,Wild times
2629,Exactly
2630,Seems to be happening a lot
2631,Very sensible. Knows how to handle exponential functions in reality.
2632,"Whether Z-pak works in this situation or not, its a kickass med for many maladies"
2633,"If Jamis needs help, he has many friends, me among them"
2634,"Pretty close. Design is evolving rapidly. Would be great to flatten domes, embed engines &amp; add ~1.5 barrel sections of propellant for same total length. Also, current legs are a bit too small."
2635,Hydroxychloroquine probably better
2636,Sounds sensible
2637,"That said, danger of panic still far exceeds danger of corona imo. If we over-allocate medical resources to corona, it will come at expense of treating other illnesses. Track graph at bottom of this page:"
2638,This paper matches what Im hearing from a lot of smart people
2639,Yeah. Fate loves irony.
2640,Whats worse is that I even told Stanford to check me for the $^* parasite &amp; they still couldnt find it!
2641,Yeah
2642,"I was first misdiagnosed at Stanford Hospital with viral meningitis, then again misdiagnosed at Sequoia. A visiting doc from San Jose General saw my charts &amp; sent me to ICU immediately. I was ~36 hours from being unrecoverable. So, I take expert advice with a grain of salt"
2643,Was also given a lot of doxycycline
2644,Maybe helpful
2645,"Yes, I received chloroquine via central line through my chest &amp; both arms. Had near fatal case of falciparum. Wouldve died for sure if not for chloroquine. Doesnt mean it works for C19, but maybe better than nothing."
2646,Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19
2647,"Slight booster length increase to m, so m for whole system. Liftoff mass ~5000 mT."
2648,Fear is the mind-killer
2649,Congratulations Giga NY team!
2650,"Some parts will use L, as it has higher toughness at cryo temps. Will move to internally developed alloys probably end of year."
2651,Probably. Raptor sounds different to Merlin.
2652,Lot of Raptors coming through! Now operating both horizontal &amp; vertical firing stands in McGregor.
2653,Sure
2654,Will discuss with team
2655,Yes
2656,Once production has exceeded preorders
2657,Yes
2658,True
2659,Pretty much
2660,Coming soon
2661,The Permian-Triassic was super bad
2662,"To be totally frank, I did an image search on my phone &amp; posted without looking closely"
2663,Nice work!
2664,"Yes, its in my Twitter banner pic"
2665,We should be excited about the future &amp; striving to go beyond the horizon!
2666,Good one
2667,Thats the goal!
2668,Wacktivism!
2669,And so annoying
2670,"Moral condemnation used not for morality, but as a weapon for manipulation is messed up"
2671,Moon too
2672,The people have spoken!
2673,Checking
2674,"Mars is god of war &amp; memes are a form of war and fun too! Neither will be destroyed. Ceres, moons of Jupiter &amp; Saturn prob come next."
2675,Sure
2676,"To those who quietly help advance the causes we mutually believe in, knowing advancing the cause is the only reward: thank you"
2677,"Thank you for your kind words, brother"
2678,Former
2679,Model Y production for east coast too
2680,Scouting locations for Cybertruck Gigafactory. Will be central USA.
2681,With an epic sound system &amp; woofers the size of a car
2682,Definitely
2683,And Rammstein
2684,Haha true
2685,"Yes, for now"
2686,"Ok fine, that was good haha"
2687,Tesla should have a mega rave cave under the Berlin Gigafatory
2688,Lucent Dossier in &amp; I think I saw in but didnt realize who it was until later
2689,Busted
2690,Was good maybe or years ago when you could wonder around &amp; find great unknown bands
2691,Too much corporate sponsorship killed the vibe
2692,Coachella should postpone itself until it stops sucking
2693,Ben &amp; Jerrys cookie dough is also next-level. Cant have that in the house. Its too good!
2694,Choc milk is even better than people remember. Its incredible.
2695,Congratulations Tesla team on making our th car!!
2696,"Market was bit high anyway, so due for a correction"
2697,"Static fire &amp; short flights with SN3, longer flights with SN4, but spooling up the whole Starship/Raptor production line is really what matters"
2698,SN2 (with thrust puck) passed cryo pressure &amp; engine thrust load tests late last night
2699,He studied the blade
2700,Memes are powerful
2701,Ships with a lot of people &amp; limited medical facilities are a serious issue
2702,"Yeah, thats a great one"
2703,"Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!"
2704,"Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!"
2705,"Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality."
2706,Yeah
2707,Accurate
2708,Envelope expanded
2709,"Recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. If this (land) landing fails, it will most likely be for a different reason."
2710,Rocket will land in highest winds ever at Cape Canaveral tonight. This is intentional envelope expansion.
2711,Final Dragon Version mission tonight
2712,The coronavirus panic is dumb
2713,Raising art to new heights
2714,"Also, when tech is new, catalog engineering isnt possible, as there is no catalog. Has to be first principles."
2715,Were making progress. Improved rules are going through the EU standards committees. Hopefully better in a few months.
2716,"Cool, were tracking to release more FSD features later this month"
2717,"True. Oddly, those who complained didnt actually order FSD. Perhaps they werent aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery."
2718,Mad respect for the makers of things
2719,Bernies tax rate is % too high!
2720,"No matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated."
2721,Sleeving SN2 dome in the high bay
2722,They have the best coin
2723,Dogs rock
2724,bro
2725,Track mode V2 is pretty cool. Maybe too complicated to use though? Lmk thoughts for improvement.
2726,This is vital
2727,Just want say that I support as Twitter CEO. He has a good .
2728,Definitely
2729,"Were stripping SN2 to bare minimum to test the thrust puck to dome weld under pressure, first with water, then at cryo. Hopefully, ready to test in a few days."
2730,Theres a puck at the base that takes the engine thrust load. Dont shuck the puck!
2731,Wheres Flextape when you need it!?
2732,"Its fine, well just buff it out"
2733,So how was your night?
2734,"Yes, dramatically improved imo"
2735,"We need to finish work on Autopilot core foundation code &amp; D labelling, then functionality will happen quickly. Not long now."
2736,I just sent a note to Twitter to clarify that posting SpaceX videos is fine by us and we paid for rights to Bowie song for the Falcon Heavy launch
2737,"The competitor should be a drone fighter plane thats remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it."
2738,Its not that big really
2739,Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design
2740,Its not mine
2741,Definitely! Whats in that sky city thing!? Needs a prequel even more than a sequel.
2742,Sure
2743,Posting SpaceX videos is definitely not copyright infringement!
2744,"Hopefully, in March. Checking"
2745,I had no idea this existed. Sounds awesome though!
2746,"Full disclosure, Im actually a year old vampire. Its such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!"
2747,"We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat &amp; strong, were building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement."
2748,Yes
2749,on SN2
2750,SN2 tank integration starts this week with much less circumferential pucker. Thanks Fronius!
2751,Starship SN1 tank preparing for Raptor attachment &amp; static fire
2752,some are good tho
2753,And thats why cones were invented
2754,Tinny
2755,Rococo is alive &amp; living in our hearts
2756,Woody
2757,I did
2758,Battle Angel Starship
2759,Teslas in a tunnel. Happening in Vegas rn.
2760,obv
2761,On a wall in Austin
2762,BGII was amazing
2763,Getting there was super hard. Very proud of Tesla team!
2764,Model achieves mile actual range vs EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing
2765,"Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient &amp; range, latter factoring in route elevation changes &amp; cargo or tow mass &amp; drag impact"
2766,Its slightly better
2767,Definitely worth trying imo
2768,"Btw, in some prior tweets Id said production Cybertruck would be ~80 wide (vs ~84 body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to , but come standard with upper laser blade lights."
2769,Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
2770,Science has gone too far
2771,F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
2772,"Its mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs."
2773,"Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main."
2774,LOX
2775,These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply of iterations * progress between iterations.
2776,Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
2777,Probably
2778,Attach wheels to the landing legs &amp; tow Starship to the launch pad
2779,I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
2780,"High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done!"
2781,"The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach + anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit"
2782,"There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine."
2783,"Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters."
2784,"O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank"
2785,In the order that they were written
2786,Worth reading Asimovs Foundation
2787,"SN + will have better fit &amp; weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length."
2788,The Persuader hammer will fix SN1
2789,Rocket nosecone production in Texas
2790,Yes
2791,Glad youre all ok!
2792,Tim Curry ftw
2793,makeup
2794,"Unfortunately, I must agree that these are reasonable concerns"
2795,"True, that was pretty impressive"
2796,My conversations with Gates have been underwhelming tbh
2797,Both
2798,"All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla"
2799,I have no control &amp; only very limited insight into OpenAI. Confidence in Dario for safety is not high.
2800,OpenAI should be more open imo
2801,"Initially, yes, but then will make sense to localize closer to customers. Pretty much same plan as vehicles."
2802,Looking forward to international expansion later this year
2803,"Tesla is ramping up Solar Roof installation across the USA! Training will be provided, so no prior experience needed. Apply at"
2804,Direct links arent needed to offer service. Starlink will initially bounce signals off ground/ocean relays to get from to .
2805,albedo will drop significantly on almost every successive launch
2806,Haha
2807,"Sorry, probably going to be a lot of rocket pics from"
2808,X will also improve by a similar amount
2809,"Depends on when car was built, as there are many small hardware improvements, so most will be somewhere in between &amp;"
2810,"Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +"
2811,"Theres a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant."
2812,Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
2813,Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
2814,Maybe possible with improved wheels/tires (which would be available to all previously made cars)
2815,All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.
2816,Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above miles or ~630 km
2817,Run a physics sim long enough &amp; youll get intelligence
2818,Thanks to all who caught the error
2819,a=F/m is the most fun
2820,Editing error. Meant to say t/(2E). Interesting that monochrome is roughly a millionth of a percent.
2821,Frame rate t2/E
2822,The resolution of reality
2823,Reminded me of The Lady of Shalott by Waterhouse
2824,Haha
2825,unNERVing
2826,"The joints will have shielding, but its hard to ensure a good seal. Transpiration cooling (or simply higher pressure cold gas flow) would purge the area behind the hot gas seal."
2827,Might be used around flap joints
2828,Will take action
2829,Only the heart senses beauty
2830,Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds
2831,be still my beating heart
2832,"Unfortunately, Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side, but none required on leeward. Even windward shielding is very light."
2833,Whoop whoop!!
2834,Thanks Mom!!!
2835,This does seem high
2836,And some vitamin k too
2837,Ok u can have a little emerald
2838,This is incorrect. No air suspension planned for /Y. Only S/X &amp; Cybertruck have/will have air suspension.
2839,sthetics
2840,The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics &amp; energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
2841,"Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass &amp; several other products. Will also offer customer &amp; media tours."
2842,Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. Its stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos dont do it justice.
2843,"Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"
2844,Coming hopefully later this year
2845,"I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!"
2846,"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, its very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."
2847,Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.
2848,Ok
2849,Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
2850,Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.
2851,"Probably months or so. is certainly fine for orbit, but SpaceX X will be better."
2852,Midsection of Starship propellant tanks
2853,"Yes, but we want to focus on textured black first, then move into Earth tones &amp; convolutions"
2854,Your comment above: Who in their right mind would buy an ICE after knowing its residual value will be zilch? Legacy auto: go EV or go BUST! is super important for car buyers. Residual values for gas/diesel cars will plummet in coming years.
2855,Haha

2867,Ok
2868,My Mom wrote a book

2870,"Once upon a time, we were all just hydrogen in a vacuum"
2871,"Impressive, if uncurated. There arent many errors. Would be interesting to see how GPT would perform with same objective."
2872,cropping
2873,Haha true
2874,Youre welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
2875,"Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of mm steel vs mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a mm diameter."
2876,"No, theyre SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time."
2877,"Yes, were tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area"
2878,"That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because its built inside a factory in volume."
2879,"This isnt quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision thats X to X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."
2880,"SpaceX started with a mariachi band party. Great vibes here in Boca Chica, Texas!"
2881,True
2882,Late night tweets sigh
2883,We saw them a lot launching from Kwajalein in the early days of SpaceX
2884,New emoji! Last one comes with free phone hack.
2885,Great shot

2906,Starship Concerto in Zero G
2907,Yes
2908,Yes
2909,Giga Texas?
2910,Uh oh
2911,Have you tried a hydrophobic spray?
2912,"This is mainly for staffing up production shifts for /7 operations, but engineers, supervisors &amp; support personnel are certainly needed too. A super hardcore work ethic, talent for building things, common sense &amp; trustworthiness are required, the rest we can train."
2913,"Starship career day at the Stargate building (Boca Chica Blvd, TX) this Thursday from pm to pm!"
2914,Going max hardcore on design/production Starship here in Boca. Its awesome! Feels a bit like a Mars simulator.
2915,Definitely!
2916,Yes
2917,"First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards."
2918,"Ok sure Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldnt be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory."
2919,"Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities Im unaware of"
2920,"True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature"
2921,"It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Dont want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo."
2922,Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. Its *awesome*.
2923,Probably this summer
2924,"Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better."
2925,PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
2926,"Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test."
2927,"The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks."
2928,Sorry!
2929,A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is whats truly hard). Dont care if you even graduated high school.
2930,"Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency"
2931,Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
2932,"We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin"
2933,"Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later."
2934,"Our custom TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets"
2935,"Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with"
2936,"At Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isnt just icing on the cake, it the cake - Join AI at Tesla! It reports directly to me &amp; we meet/email/text almost every day. My actions, not just words, show how critically I view (benign) AI."
2937,"Unfortunately, this is true. It doesnt matter how skilled you are if youre trapped in a giant bureaucracy."
2938,Desperate times call for desperate measures
2939,"Only years from first controlled, powered flight to landing on the moon. Now, half a century later, we are still unable to return. This must change."
2940,Haha true
2941,The safest place to hide a dead body is the second page of Google search results!
2942,"Trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who arent being paid to push an agenda or scam. Google still shows bs/scam pages, theyre just several clicks away."
2943,"This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things"
2944,Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.
2945,The crypto scam level on Twitter is reaching new levels. This is not cool.
2946,Yes
2947,"We should make buildings out of high-strength steel, not concrete (which needs steel in it anyway)"
2948,Nice
2949,Dont Doubt ur Vibe now on Spotify
2950,I appreciate the kind words!
2951,Those old ladies are wise
2952,"Meant to say other forms of the cold, not influenza"
2953,There is considerable conflation of diagnosis &amp; contraction of corona. Actual virality is much lower than it would seem. I think this will turn out to be comparable to other forms of influenza. World War Z it is not.
2954,I become Tiesto at night

2961,Be cause its true
2962,Releasing soon on Emo G Records!
2963,"Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 &amp; water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen &amp; Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel."
2964,This number wont leave me alone!
2965,Just wrote a song called Dont doubt yer vibe
2966,we r sml
2967,"Ok, not so bad"
2968,Who is hating on ISRU &amp; why? Doesnt make sense.
2969,A friend just sent me this excerpt from a Tesla blog I wrote years ago
2970,"Tonnage delivered to orbit, normalized to LEO, would be interesting to see"
2971,"If all goes well, Falcon will achieve triple digits this year"
2972,Ice
2973,bar
2974,Liquid nitrogen cryogenic strength test underway
2975,Matter is extremely fluffy!
2976,Chairs are underappreciated
2977,The stars in Starships mirrored hull reflected
2978,Already being done
2979,"Parent material strength roughly doubles, so weld strength is the only real question mark"
2980,First two domes of SN1 are almost complete
2981,Yes
2982,Starship m test tank made bar at room temp! Small leak at a weld doubler. Will be repaired &amp; retested at cryo.
2983,The good old days!
2984,Were working on it
2985,Too niche
2986,Nice
2987,Meme necromancy
2988,"Going with nomenclature of Giga [most widely understood location name] vs Giga , so Giga Shanghai, Giga Nevada, Giga New York &amp; Giga Berlin"
2989,"For sure. Giga Berlin will build sustainable energy vehicles using sustainable energy, so net environmental impact will be extremely positive!"
2990,Yes
2991,Yes
2992,Exactly!
2993,Giga Berlin / GF4 will absolutely be designed with sustainability and the environment in mind
2994,"Sounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla wont use this much net water on a daily basis. Its possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event. Also, this is not a natural forest it was planted for use as cardboard &amp; only a small part will be used for GF4."
2995,V3 Supercharger deployment will accelerate considerably this year
2996,"Yeah, system should adapt to most likely destination &amp; anticipate school, then work, if thats owner preference"
2997,Definitely
2998,Ok
2999,"We should have a base on the moon, a city on Mars"
3000,I love that Heart of Gold is moved by Infinite Improbability

3005,Blazing Saddles
3006,Working on it
3007,Its on the list
3008,Want to play The Witcher game on your Tesla? (you can already watch the show on Tesla Netflix theater)
3009,Explains the sad lack of progress in candy research!
3010,"Yeah, doors are ft wide"
3011,"Yeah, we just finished two more propellant domes. SpaceX team &amp; supporting suppliers are doing amazing work ramping Starship production."
3012,Nice shot
3013,Improved Accommodations
3014,Yay!
3015,Would like to take a moment to thank Michael &amp; Zeev for helping Tesla. It was very hard work &amp; both couldve just rested on their laurels. Much appreciated .
3016,Walk this way
3017,Great talking with !
3018,"Michael Marks, then Zeev Drori, but I helped out as co-CEO as they didnt have much automotive domain expertise"
3019,Dragon trunk from in-flight abort test is in surprisingly good shape!
3020,Exactly
3021,"Thanks on behalf of the team! Thank you also for the support has provided over the years, without which this would not have happened."
3022,Haha
3023,"Dragon high altitude, supersonic abort test is a risky mission, as its pushing the envelope in so many ways"
3024,mins from liftoff
3025,Yes
3026,Meteor!!
3027,Yes
3028,Best place to view is from the beach. Excitement guaranteed!
3029,"Dragon Spacecraft supersonic abort test coming up either tomorrow or Sunday, depending on weather"
3030,What should we change?
3031,"Munros analysis of Tesla engineering is accurate, both pro &amp; con. I think he will appreciate some elements of the Model Y body design."
3032,"Even more important for a a reusable rocket, as cost of propellant actually becomes relevant &amp; anything below T/W of is wasted fuel &amp; oxygen"
3033,Hehehe
3034,Helping to pay for this is why Im accumulating assets on Earth.
3035,"Loading the Mars fleet into Earth orbit, then ships depart over ~30 days every months. Battlestar Galactica"
3036,"Aiming for to years, like aircraft"
3037,Yes. There will be a lot of jobs on Mars!
3038,"Needs to be such that anyone can go if they want, with loans available for those who dont have money"
3039,Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars.
3040,Yes
3041,Thats the goal
3042,Building Starships/year gets to in years or megatons/year or maybe around k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
3043,"Starship design goal is flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at &gt;100 tons/flight, so every ships yield megaton per year to orbit"
3044,Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
3045,Thats about right
3046,Reaction to Cyberpunk slipping release date to September
3047,"Whats amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."
3048,"Densification isnt needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but its an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed"
3049,"Fundamental issue with SLS is that its not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! tragedy."
3050,"Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"
3051,"Sorry, migh have brought the site down"
3052,"Starship orbital vehicle SN1, liquid oxygen header tank &amp; nosecone"
3053,Just saw this today. Tesla refunds in general should be easy to get electronically &amp; certainly through customer service. Will he addressed.
3054,"Very true. Whats really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs &amp; how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earths surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun."
3055,"Advancing humanitys understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX! Starship can put giant in orbit &amp; on moon. With an occluder, could image in other star systems."
3056,One persons MRI machine is anothers railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though.
3057,"Exactly. Weve had good discussions with leading astronomers. One way or another, well make sure Starlink doesnt inhibit new discoveries or change the character of the night sky."
3058,Great song
3059,T-shirt is bulletproof &amp; makes u buff!
3060,Thanks for mentioning! We shouldve done this ages ago.
3061,"Good analysis, although a bit conservative imo. However, using a high upper bound for land area thats *still* a tiny % of the US prob helps convert some naysayers. That giant fusion reactor in the sky called the sun outputs a truly staggering amount of energy!"
3062,They will
3063,We need more emojis!!
3064,"And, of course, your car will be able to in their general direction"
3065,For sure!! This will make for some epic robber confusion
3066,Teslas will soon talk to people if you want. This is real.
3067,Should be able to post video of Raptor on Tripod soon
3068,"Ok, tho could be gnarly"
3069,Destroyed in Dragon fire
3070,"We tried to design a way to save B1046, but not possible"
3071,Critical test launch before flying astronauts is green for Jan
3072,Soon
3073,Hard gothic
3074,Haha
3075,We are trapped in a prison of fonts
3076,Yes
3077,Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank its just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they dont collapse when depressurized on the ground.
3078,"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
3079,A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
3080,"Dome to barrel weld made it to bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the factor of safety needed for crewed flight."
3081,Great idea
3082,Toss a coin to ur Witcher

3095,Nice
3096,"Since theres only one main engine, which gives pitch and yaw control, roll control is provided by the nitrogen attitude control thrusters"
3097,"Looks like a thin, flat, round UFO on a stick. Starlink Terminal has motors to self-adjust optimal angle to view sky. Instructions are simply: - Plug in socket - Point at sky These instructions work in either order. No training required."

3114,Congratulations Tesla &amp; SpaceX on great ! You rock!! Looking forward to epic
3115,No one suspected his disguise
3116,Carlos Gone
3117,Its a bit slow
3118,Its not ready yet
3119,Explains
3120,Thanks all Tesla club members for helping out! Looking forward to seeing you there tomorrow.
3121,Rest in peace Syd Mead. Your art will endure.
3122,C tbh
3123,"Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque."
3124,"Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard"
3125,Headed to Tesla Fremont factory tomorrow to help with vehicle deliveries
3126,Biting off more than I can chew. Because Im an optimistic fool.
3127,Hard to believe its almost time to retire Cargo Dragon after a decade of solid service
3128,Exactly
3129,Will talk about that on Q4 call
3130,"Yeah, engineering is ~90% of my time at SpaceX &amp; about ~60% at Tesla"
3131,Barrel on dome
3132,Took me an embarrassingly long time to learn that
3133,Sounds about right
3134,Beyond awesome. He was the real deal.
3135,Seems so long ago
3136,Yes
3137,"Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said."
3138,"The less code, the better! point for adding a line of code, but points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."
3139,"Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. Its like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!"
3140,"Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn"
3141,Coming
3142,Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard stainless barrels &amp; domes?
3143,Were focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
3144,Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
3145,"Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool."
3146,"No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor"
3147,Yeah
3148,"Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in ."
3149,"Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; % mass reduction."
3150,"We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."
3151,Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome
3152,Haha true
3153,muffin or not-muffin
3154,"Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship."
3155,"New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zenos Paradox at any given point, youre halfway there"
3156,"Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months"
3157,Simulation of first crewed flight of Falcon / Dragon
3158,"years later, the simulation is mostly real"
3159,Amazing work by Tesla China team!!
3160,Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW. Its tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains.
3161,Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working?
3162,"I def believe in the ethical treatment of animals &amp; taking action of climate, but these are mostly separate moral issues"
3163,Nice
3164,"Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isnt critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!"
3165,Ok
3166,"I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but its true that everyone going vegan still wouldnt stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere &amp; oceans is fundamentally the issue."
3167,Dam now rly want choc chip muffin
3168,Slight tweak to the glass needed &amp; then it should be good to go
3169,What is the platonic ideal of the perfect candy? Really feels like candy R&amp hasnt improved in ages. Damn candy oligarchs!! [shakes fist at sky]
3170,"Yeah, Boring Bricks are def coming, but whole team is focused on getting Vegas Convention Center tunnel operational so people can try it out, suggest improvements, etc. I crowdsourcing ideas with people who really care about making great products!"
3171,"Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we dont try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever."
3172,"Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
3173,Pretty much
3174,Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
3175,"No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; its getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
3176,"That might have something to do with it. Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only theyd listened to Lenins last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."
3177,"For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."
3178,Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.
3179,you too sis
3180,Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard.
3181,Literally. It was at th &amp; Baltimore in Philadelphia before gentrification.
3182,Ramones &amp; Bach
3183,"I hope someone has pics! My Mom came to visit one weekend &amp; was quite surprised by it all, but helped work coat check &amp; guarded the cash with a kitchen knife"
3184,"To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub &amp; charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day blacklights, luminescent spray paint &amp; metal junk sculptures."
3185,you too
3186,Sounds like a Marxist with style
3187,Exactly
3188,"Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories Ive ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone."
3189,"This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Moms cousins farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford."
3190,"This person blocked me, so cant read the tweet. Whats their deal?"
3191,"We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy he is greatly missed). My Dad provided % of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round wouldve happened anyway."
3192,"He didnt own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldnt even afford a nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?"
3193,Pretty much
3194,Federal
3195,Probably . Depends on regulatory approvals.
3196,Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of . Def by .
3197,"Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For close stars, a laser sail is good too."
3198,"Yes, but its too secret"
3199,Hopefully fully operational in
3200,"Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects"
3201,"No, hes still much faster"
3202,"These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them."
3203,Done by dawn
3204,That would be a fringe benefit
3205,"Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic"
3206,Flight is hopefully to months away
3207,"Were now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0."
3208,Was up all night with SpaceX team working on Starship tank dome production (most difficult part of primary structure). Dawn arrives
3209,Please stop spamming bleak links into a paywall
3210,Ok
3211,Activating engine two
3212,It is an honor &amp; a privilege to work with so many great engineers
3213,The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
3214,"Its not that these things cant be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."
3215,Future feature
3216,"Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all."
3217,"Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someones on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in + countries results in many corner cases!"
3218,"Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."
3219,Were building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
3220,Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
3221,Most people still dont know its there
3222,"Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar"
3223,"If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"
3224,Merry Christmas Hope youre enjoying latest software update!
3225,Yer welcome son
3226,"Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar, should do work in morning &amp; home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled)."
3227,That is odd. Try pressing both scroll wheel buttons to reboot. Have forwarded this to service.
3228,No
3229,Coming soon
3230,They should double down on insanity of Cats. Right move.

3237,stock art
3238,Whoa the stock is so high lol
3239,"Big communication penalty for remote work, which means the gain in talent that wont move has to be very high"

3247,Write games
3248,Yes
3249,"Regarding .X to hardware update, that should happen in earnest in Q1. Software feature delta was zero until now, so not much point in doing it before then."
3250,"Pretty much, although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems sooner, Id love it. The real constraint is finding great software engineers."
3251,Ok sure
3252,Sorry for the delay on V2.X! We just couldnt get it all done in time.
3253,"Unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever"
3254,"Sorry, its been a bit of a struggle. Software team has been working all weekend to resolve last minute issues. Hopefully starts rolling out tonight."
3255,"My wiki is a war zone with a zillion edits. At least its obviously not curated! Some day, I should probably write what *my* fictionalized version of reality is"
3256,Yes
3257,"Started Zip2 with ~$2k &amp; ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into X/PayPal, rolled proceeds again into SpaceX/Tesla, but these are all companies where I played fundamental founding role. Not right to ask others to put in money if I dont put in mine."
3258,"If Tesla &amp; SpaceX go bankrupt, so will I. As it should be."
3259,"Just looked at my wiki for st time in years. Its insane! Btw, can someone please delete investor. I do basically zero investing."
3260,Pre VFX cut would be $$$$

3276,For sure!
3277,Orbit is hard. Best wishes for landing &amp; swift recovery to next mission.
3278,Does it like the smiths?
3279,"Needs a few more days of validation, then early access, then wide release"
3280,"Tesla holiday software update has FSD sneak preview, Stardew Valley, Lost Backgammon &amp; a few other things"
3281,You dont hear much about element
3282,"No, as thats OG Mobileye hardware"
3283,Cinnamon toast crunch
3284,"This is quite a thorny hardware problem, as there are many diff versions of mcu &amp; autopilot computer &amp; supporting hardware. Cars last so much longer than phones! Hopefully able to upgrade mcu1 &amp; ap2.0 in a few months."
3285,This mode will show pic of moth &amp; play the smiths
3286,Lmpe
3287,Tesla Moth Mode (better late than never)
3288,"Yes, just costs a few thousand dollars &amp; is more complex than a board swap. Bunch of connectors &amp; antennas need to change. We can improve the speed a little with software optimization, which might be enough."
3289,I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
3290,This is a great meme
3291,MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isnt needed for full self-driving &amp; cost is ~$2k for limited entertainment improvements.
3292,"Never trust cynics, as they excuse their own bad deeds by telling themselves everyone does it"
3293,"Yes, probably &amp; partially"
3294,Some good ideas here!
3295,"Telemetry indicates soft touchdown on the water, so fairing might still be reusable"
3296,Sigh
3297,"Possibly Excession, but Id recommend reading Player of Games &amp; Surface Detail first. Theyre all great."
3298,Yes

3317,"If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing &amp; the tutorial is way too long"
3318,Sure
3319,Root of energy to mass ratio is max render speed of the simulation
3320,Math jokes have a small audience
3321,Kids these days have no respect!
3322,Thats the one!
3323,It really does
3324,"They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! Its pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars."
3325,"Yeah, i that I bought in for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the speed transmission failed."
3326,"Couldnt afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, thats me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol."
3327,Maybe on Starship? Its def got the payload capacity
3328,Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
3329,"Yeah, its one of my favorite T-shirts!"
3330,"Well aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We wont do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was ."
3331,Your Twitter comments are great btw!
3332,Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. Its better because of you!
3333,"This may sound crazy, but asking real people what theyd like in a product is a great way to meet their needs"
3334,There will be no loss of either
3335,"That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width"
3336,"True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages."
3337,We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by + inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
3338,Speed solves everything
3339,"Hes def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a by mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs"
3340,"Super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great &amp; costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels!"
3341,Huge admiration &amp; respect for the Tesla China team. Their talent &amp; drive is amazing!
3342,For sure
3343,"If we create a city on Mars, Earth-Mars travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive"
3344,Launching third flight of this Dragon spacecraft to tomorrow
3345,Yes
3346,"After a while, hydrogen became sentient"
3347,"Bravo, right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal."
3348,"People often think theyre breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O &amp; a dash of neon &amp; krypton (etc.)"
3349,"Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement"
3350,Still cant believe how hard it was to get !
3351,We sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us &amp; then he said yes
3352,"Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us!"
3353,Its artificial
3354,Do you like our owl?
3355,"Overall shape is good for low drag coefficient. Matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges &amp; guide air around wheels, like an invisible sculpture."
3356,Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated
3357,Thats why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control
3358,"Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel."
3359,They are dead to me
3360,Its a generational thing
3361,"With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details."
3362,Touch
3363,Just because he has a flamethrower and I have a flamethrower doesnt mean um ok fine Im Hank Scorpio
3364,This one is deep. Happy Thanksgiving!
3365,The finest in apocalypse protection technology! Flamethrower optional.
3366,Def not dainty
3367,"Yes, Cybertruck will have steel balls"
3368,k
3369,Wed be happy to help
3370,"Sure, will aim to do this next week"
3371,"Agreed, this will be exciting to see!"
3372,"Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation."
3373,Bring it on
3374,Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!
3375,k
3376,"Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didnt bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time"
3377,Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill
3378,"Higher hardness, higher strength &amp; doesnt cost crazy money for ~3mm skins"
3379,"In general, this is something Tesla should do"
3380,We should def make it good to hang out there
3381,"Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year"
3382,"Good question. Its a new variant of series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press."
3383,Can be wrapped in any color!
3384,The body panels will actually be laser cut!
3385,"Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too"
3386,Interesting idea
3387,True
3388,Really? Ok sure.
3389,Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
3390,"Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then Im confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count."
3391,Study the Blade!!
3392,"Were creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but well need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it cant be made using standard methods."
3393,"Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled X stainless is much stronger."
3394,"Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made"
3395,"Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you cant stamp ultra-hard X steel, because it breaks the stamping press"
3396,Excellent review by Marques!
3397,k
3398,Yes
3399,Haha v true
3400,With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement
3401,"k Cybertruck orders so far, with % choosing dual, % tri &amp; % single motor"
3402,Great analysis
3403,That would be cool
3404,Gonna have some sick attachments
3405,Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)
3406,Riding in the Cybertruck
3407,Sure
3408,Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha.
3409,Syd Mead
3410,We threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event &amp; didnt even scratch the glass!
3411,"Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche . Order Cybertruck online at"
3412,Yes
3413,"Will be an option to add solar power that generates miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate to miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is ."
3414,Tesla person electric ATV will come at first as an option for Cybertruck
3415,See ya in
3416,Nobody *expects* the Cybertruck
3417,Yup
3418,Haha
3419,High time we had a Tesla coil!
3420,Cybertruck design influenced partly by The Spy Who Loved Me
3421,Coming soon! Were working to complete the full Supercharger route from London to Shanghai.
3422,Tesla Cybertruck (pressurized edition) will be official truck of Mars
3423,Of course
3424,Fun party guaranteed!
3425,Long journey
3426,Tonight
3427,"Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different."
3428,Maybe wont need a key at all
3429,"So many reporters gave Chanos airtime when he called Tesla a worthless fraud. Now that he has been proven wrong, silence"
3430,Gravitas is overrated
3431,That would be cool
3432,"National Science Foundation, u should add a W to ur name. Would get way more clicks. Ur welcome."
3433,% of people want to gentrify Mordor
3434,The China space industry is very impressive
3435,Cephalopods have a strange intelligence
3436,It certainly does
3437,True
3438,Not sure. Maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?
3439,"Even Toyota, who made the Prius. That is sad."
3440,Guess I was obsessed with space from an early age. Fair point.
3441,Id be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. Its like a kids drawing.
3442,"Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too."
3443,Exactly! Well said.
3444,Surprisingly common
3445,Cybertruck unveil Thursday night
3446,Innovation comes in many ways
3447,Meaning not fair that Boeing gets so much more for the same thing
3448,This doesnt seem right
3449,True
3450,Semi-infinite
3451,Seems likely. = hipsters.
3452,"Right now, trajectory of neuro-silicon symbiosis doesnt appear to intersect trajectory of AGI. Goal of Neuralink is to raise this probability above %."
3453,We fought the Balrog last year
3454,Gentrify Mordor?
3455,It was Tacheles
3456,Memes are modern art
3457,F8 irony
3458,There will be many opportunities for both new &amp; experienced people!
3459,fomo yolo
3460,"Yeah, makes sense"
3461,Congrats to Tesla team on Model winning best midsize car in Germany!
3462,"Will build batteries, powertrains &amp; vehicles, starting with Model Y"
3463,GIGA BERLIN
3464,Congratulations!
3465,Starlink vertical on the pad
3466,Yes
3467,Haha
3468,Exactly
3469,"Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species"
3470,Bad logic is always ugly
3471,Same goes for digital super intelligence denial
3472,MPGe!
3473,Yes
3474,Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
3475,"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as tons/year."
3476,"Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldnt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine , although probably engines + can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
3477,Pretty much
3478,"Exactly! Its also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
3479,"No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. Thats the sales pitch. Want to go?"
3480,"So it will take about years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
3481,As the planets align only once every two years
3482,A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
3483,No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is whats hard.
3484,"Current global payload to orbit capacity is about tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
3485,"If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does tons to orbit, thats a capacity of million tons of payload to orbit per year"
3486,"Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as its designed to fly X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
3487,The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
3488,Gas/diesel cars too
3489,True
3490,Extremism is so fun! ()
3491,Of course!
3492,Yes
3493,The date is strangely familiar
3494,Cybertruck unveil on Nov in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
3495,Looking into it
3496,Yes
3497,"The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF"
3498,Naturally
3499,This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called Pitch Day &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They dont buy APCs. Its the Air Force.
3500,Fair point. Coming soon. Were making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. FA right after that.
3501,"Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
3502,More to come
3503,Yes
3504,Would be odd to expect anything else
3505,"That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
3506,"Wow, seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every hours. No boats needed."
3507,Great poem
3508,"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, weve only done multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so more left to reach successful tests in a row."
3509,"Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called Low Gear!"
3510,Tesla Solarglass vs Happy Halloween!!
3511,"Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong"
3512,"Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, theres a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in to &amp; /4 mile races."
3513,Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
3514,Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar!
3515,Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
3516,The fires are all too real
3517,Haha true
3518,snacks
3519,"Hard to say with high accuracy, but to weeks is my best guess"
3520,"Soon, SpaceX will launch astronauts to !"
3521,Thats significantly improved in current production
3522,"True, my name literally means tree"
3523,"If you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if youre home &amp; to home if at work. Not sure if thats in wide release yet, but def in early access. Its an awesome feature."
3524,Just a reminder that the Tesla Full Self-Driving option goes up by $1000 at midnight on Nov for all regions that have Smart Summon. Order your car online at .
3525,"I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill."
3526,For Treebeard
3527,"Ok, sounds legit, will donate M trees"
3528,Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
3529,Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
3530,"Were changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc"
3531,"Very true. Glass doesnt burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs."
3532,I hate advertising
3533,"Unfortunately, its hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to to add solar to an existing roof &amp; for a new roof with integrated solar."
3534,"We dont make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot"
3535,"If youre directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today"
3536,"Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires"
3537,So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
3538,"Homes with solar sell for % more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important."
3539,Id recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
3540,Extremely high
3541,Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters
3542,"US clean energy incentive drops by % on Jan , so orders must be received by roughly Nov to be installed in time"
3543,Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery backup for /7 clean energy &amp; no blackouts at
3544,Sure
3545,Took my son to play piano for the seniors home in Pasadena. It was lovely to see them smile
3546,Thanks to everyone at Tesla who worked so hard over the years to make our Fremont factory successful!
3547,Sandwich time travel is the only explanation
3548,Physics facts
3549,"Yes, you can walk on the Tesla Solarglass roof. In stilettos, if you want"
3550,Jerome is great! Tesla team in general is the strongest its ever been.
3551,"Yes, wight destruction guaranteed or your money back!"
3552,Tesla Solarglass roof
3553,Will start at ~2:15. Sorry for slight delay.
3554,Haha true
3555,Srsly
3556,Transparent aluminum is a real thing!
3557,"That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!"
3558,"Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!"
3559,"Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly."
3560,"Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth."
3561,"To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended"
3562,California time
3563,"This product may appear simple, but actually *very* difficult to get right"
3564,Will do an open call Q&amp;A
3565,Major FUD incoming for sure haha
3566,"I have V1, but will switch to V3"
3567,Tesla Solar Tile Roof V3 launch tomorrow at pm
3568,Sure
3569,But actually
3570,Super proud of Tesla team for great execution &amp; support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!!
3571,Tesla Q3 results: - Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule - Model Y ahead of schedule - Solar installs +48% from Q2 - GAAP profitable - Positive free cash flow
3572,The big rear wing is only on for one day for rear downforce calibration. Isnt needed to set ring record &amp; wont be in the production car.
3573,"Internal camera isnt used yet (meant for robotaxi), but thats a good idea"
3574,Please lmk about your experience and what can be improved
3575,Coming soon
3576,"Whoa, it worked!!"
3577,Sending this tweet through space via Starlink satellite
3578,"Homes with solar sell for % more, according to Zillow"
3579,"More carrot, less stick"
3580,"Very likely that a home with clean power thats lower cost than utility, plus blackout protection via Powerwall, will have a positive effect on value"
3581,PG&amp;E says rolling blackouts expected in California for next years!
3582,Order Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery for /7 clean power &amp; no blackouts!
3583,Going offline for a few days
3584,Both at the same time!
3585,More about dealing with failure modes &amp; roll control
3586,"Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesnt solve roll control well."
3587,"Common myth, but incorrect"
3588,And so begins the robocalypse
3589,Tesla wins best headlights award
3590,"The final configuration used at Nrburgring to set the record will go into production around summer , so this is not merely for the track"
3591,Anyone whos interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. Were gonna take this to a whole new level!
3592,Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. Im in awe.
3593,"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. Its insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you"
3594,"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing Ive ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
3595,"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
3596,And the lead character is also named Woody
3597,"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
3598,Conservation of energy tells you the answer
3599,Looking forward to Kerbal !
3600,"We def could be wrong about this, but its actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Dont need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower."
3601,"Also, were keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so thats leaving a lot on the table"
3602,"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe to sec."
3603,"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; . Target is ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
3604,Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.
3605,"This is true. All that matters is number used in v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass."
3606,"Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
3607,"Were working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that arent actual parking spaces."
3608,"Yeah, great team!"
3609,"To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth."
3610,"Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
3611,"Most people arent aware that orbit (and zero gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about times the speed of sound to stay in space."
3612,"Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly"
3613,Software
3614,Yes
3615,Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
3616,Venus would be very difficult
3617,True
3618,"Yes, we will"
3619,"It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers."
3620,"Deep Rain neural net coming soon. Were not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep."
3621,"Yep, good catch"
3622,hot pot
3623,Cybertruck doesnt look like anything Ive seen bouncing around the Internet. Its closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.
3624,Those rumors are false
3625,Coming v soon
3626,Haha
3627,Ms. Chief &amp; Ms. Tree
3628,lol
3629,Space Jam shouldve won the Oscar
3630,Recommended for sure. Both movies are incredible.
3631,"First will rewatch Godfather Part II, then Space Jam"
3632,"Underappreciated , will watch!"
3633,Is Space Jam good?
3634,So it goes
3635,Sure looks that way
3636,Nice
3637,Solar
3638,"Depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so to MW as a rough guess"
3639,"Whoa, that does look good!"
3640,Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.
3641,French fries are the devil
3642,"., are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?"
3643,Super messed up situation!
3644,Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
3645,Should be much better at this point
3646,Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
3647,"Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry"
3648,"Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist."
3649,Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
3650,"V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
3651,"When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, youll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car."
3652,Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing thats problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
3653,"Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
3654,"Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why theres a delay. Other countries are supportive."
3655,"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov"
3656,Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for /7 clean power &amp; no more blackouts!
3657,Will be throughout Canada
3658,Its something special
3659,Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future
3660,True
3661,I Asterix &amp; Obelix!
3662,Exactly
3663,Ok
3664,Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is /7 clean power with no blackouts.
3665,All Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits.
3666,Sooo annoying!!
3667,Were changing Powerwall Storm Watch to Disaster Watch. Covers more bases.
3668,Yes
3669,No change
3670,Important for Moonbase Alpha!
3671,Working on it
3672,Even Gary likes it!
3673,Its really quite fun!
3674,"But we call it caraoke, because its in a"
3675,Tesla software V10.0 comes with karaoke
3676,Yes
3677,A Shortfall of Gravitas
3678,Next update
3679,"siq burn, Gary, siq burn"
3680,Why is there no emoji for dignity!!
3681,Yes
3682,Door hinge
3683,the color orange is named after the fruit
3684,Will remove
3685,Thanks for mentioning. Should be enabled on all loaner cars.
3686,Yeah
3687,"Not easily, as requires wire harness changes"
3688,Im in the credits
3689,Worth reading Human Compatible by Stuart Russell (hes great!) about future AI risks &amp; solutions
3690,All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
3691,"We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up &amp; received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. Were focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts."
3692,"For what its worth, the SpaceX schedule, which Ive just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon &amp; Dragon at the Cape &amp; all testing done in ~10 weeks"
3693,Culture Class is really something
3694,I hope so
3695,Were doomed!
3696,Hh
3697,Haha true
3698,Done
3699,Trouble!
3700,And thats just the tip of the iceberg
3701,Agreed
3702,Good ones
3703,"Agreed, fair point"
3704,Any feature requests?
3705,"Given how quickly the world is shifting to electric vehicles, a gas/diesel vehicle bought today will probably have low resale value"
3706,"&amp; sounds too (also, of course)"
3707,Will consider
3708,Sure
3709,"Customized horn &amp; movement sounds (coconuts being one, of course) coming to Teslas soon"
3710,Haha
3711,We will understand the next question
3712,True
3713,To understand the nature of consciousness
3714,Its true
3715,Exactly
3716,Great list of hotel hacks in this thread!
3717,Excited about launching asteroid defense mission!
3718,Lets go boyz!
3719,Sorry it took so long!
3720,"Wow, cool! Summon will get steadily smoother until its like an expert chauffeur who knows you well."
3721,Welded steel
3722,Probably Starlink &amp; some fun things
3723,Rosetta by Vangelis is incredible
3724,"Not sure, will ask regulators"
3725,Enhanced should get it too
3726,Aiming for this weekend!
3727,"Hopefully, a month or two, although it may be a little silly at first"
3728,Not yet
3729,First point release update expected to go out this weekend
3730,Over Tesla Smart Summon uses in first few days!
3731,"Thanks, Tesla team is the strongest its ever been &amp; doing an amazing job! Honored to work beside them."
3732,"If km works, then orbit"
3733,Great summary of the key points!
3734,"Thats about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot &amp; have to be replaced."
3735,"Its all the secondary structure that concerns me, not engines &amp; primary airframe"
3736,"Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is &lt;$250k for V2.0 is a ton thrust-optimized engine, ie &lt;$1000/ton"
3737,Stop sending me this
3738,Agreed &amp; such a heartwarming photo
3739,I have that exact thought every time I get the flu
3740,Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
3741,Lot of ways to melt &amp; join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently &amp; with precise parts.
3742,Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right &amp; not needed with steel.
3743,"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see"
3744,Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back
3745,Haha yes
3746,"In solving for a good Mars climate, we will learn a great deal about how to do so on Earth. It is the inverse problem."
3747,Inside Starship cargo bay. Header tanks mounted in tip of nosecone to offset engine weight at rear.
3748,Cool video!
3749,"Probably our most viral feature ever. Most of the Autopilot team has been working on this, led by Ashok, CJ, Andrej &amp; many others."
3750,Good question
3751,"Rage, rage against the dying of the light"
3752,"Were going to use the pedestrian pink noise speaker to talk to people &amp; create customized horn sounds. I beg your pardon, but would you be so kind as to allow me to proceed? Said in the voice of Mr. Darcy."
3753,"Special light pattern (but not hazards, as theyre too shrill) seems right"
3754,Makes sense
3755,Precisely
3756,To make life as we know it multiplanetary
3757,Starship will allow us to inhabit other worlds
3758,Starship halves being joined
3759,Summon is improving rapidly
3760,"Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco +. If anyone has ++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing &amp; machining of Raptor far more than in design of the engine itself!"
3761,Theres so much power going through this engine that its close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
3762,Yes
3763,"Well, hopefully closer to bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it."
3764,"No, weve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above is nice to have &amp; well get around to it, but not needed for flight."
3765,Probably around or pm
3766,"What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber &amp; nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over bar or ~12,000 psi"
3767,Figure of speech
3768,"Meanwhile, back in reality"
3769,Media report was false
3770,Raptor uses milled copper channels with an inconel jacket all the way down
3771,Three Raptors on a Starship
3772,Always
3773,"Wow, its been years since we started at Boca!"
3774,"About a week. Will include slight improvements, based on initial user feedback."
3775,"We look for rare corner case issues with a limited release US build, then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities. So, soon, but hard to say exactly."
3776,"Gary, you rock!"
3777,Tesla V10.0 just started rolling out to all US Tesla owners with FSD option &amp; advanced download selected in vehicle software settings
3778,More like
3779,"Anonymous bot swarms deserve a closer examination. If theyre evolving rapidly, somethings up."
3780,"If advanced AI (beyond basic bots) hasnt been applied to manipulate social media, it wont be long before it is"
3781,Exactly
3782,That would be a nice touch
3783,"This is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so"
3784,Haha awesome
3785,We could probably do that
3786,m
3787,"Not sure we could go quite that tight, but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at users discretion"
3788,"With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They dont stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great."
3789,"Mk1 ship is around tons dry &amp; tons wet, but aiming for by Mk4 or Mk5. Total stack mass with max payload is tons."
3790,Absolutely
3791,Youre welcome! Feature requests always appreciated.
3792,"Six. Two windward, one under each fin &amp; two leeward. Provides redundancy for landing on unimproved surfaces."
3793,On the transporter
3794,Lifting lower section of Starship
3795,Exactly
3796,Impressive work by Chad &amp; Steve!
3797,"Almost entirely C++, but we did have an (advanced for the time) client-side Java app for viewing maps &amp; (weirdly) a D hockey game in VRML"
3798,Turbo Pascal
3799,"Mostly C/C++, Python &amp; SQL"
3800,It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
3801,"This includes original engineering of new factory processes &amp; cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization."
3802,"Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car"
3803,"For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise."
3804,"Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust"
3805,"Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing."
3806,"Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."
3807,"It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating"
3808,"Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the th."
3809,"Thats correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver."
3810,"Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what its worth, he has my support."
3811,Just sent a note to check
3812,Some secrets are too dangerous to be free
3813,"Between the trees and the forest floor, its like a giant mural, continued the veritable High Priest of the Harvest Season, adding that he would soon have to rake his driveway, an activity for which he will most certainly don a cashmere scarf."
3814,"Hoping to open in Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia &amp; most of Eastern Europe early next year. Finally, we will do Nikola Tesla proud by having his cars in his countries of origin!"
3815,OG Roadster is def helping us out here with M miles by itself
3816,Ahem well um
3817,"Classified as a URO, unidentified road object (from Area )"
3818,"SpaceX Foundry is used exclusively for advanced alloys/shapes for Raptor, incl our superalloy, SX500"
3819,Bottom half of Starship at night. Top half with forward fins &amp; header tanks probably stacks on Wednesday. Three Raptors already installed.
3820,Raceway &amp; flap hinge aero covers
3821,Just leaving SpaceX Starship build site in Boca
3822,"Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon , but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver."
3823,Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
3824,"For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure."
3825,"Current analysis, which Im not fully bought into, suggests that rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
3826,"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward fin would simply be used as a leg."
3827,Stability is not an issue with
3828,"Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom."
3829,"Yes. Theres a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we havent closed it out."
3830,"Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica, Texas"
3831,Thanks!
3832,"Either way, sustainable energy wins!!"
3833,srsly
3834,Its my glasses
3835,"Sure. Have to do it on Mars from beginning. Will ultimately do that on Earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term."
3836,Next quarter
3837,"Will discuss with my product team next week, but probably"
3838,Yes
3839,Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. The Apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem!
3840,A year old who has better reasoning &amp; more heart than the vast majority of political leaders
3841,Thats what life was like back in
3842,You have been warned
3843,"No, its one integrated release"
3844,"Fixing several minor bugs &amp; a regression in highway driving, so probably early to mid next week"
3845,Much better chess engine coming
3846,Well said
3847,Very meaningful action by the company that invented the internal combustion engine. People will remember this day. Respect.
3848,Electric is the future! Congratulations Daimler!!

3866,Apollo
3867,Landing leg frame
3868,Yes
3869,Glad youre ok!
3870,You never know
3871,Exactly
3872,"Actually, Model would beat the Taycan on Nrburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range"
3873,"No, but very close"
3874,"Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys &amp; Talulah in the seat Model S several years ago."
3875,Absolutely
3876,New Roadster and X will come later
3877,"No, original forward facing seats plus rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before."
3878,Its a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.
3879,"Thanks, I will stop by on the th!"

3885,Great conversation-starter!
3886,Damn
3887,I want this T-shirt!
3888,"Service center expansion is at max speed, so yes"
3889,"Sure, Im planning on meeting community supporters around the presentation on the th. Thanks!"
3890,Maybe we can buffer enough of it onboard. Will check.
3891,Starship Team
3892,Thats what we believe is highly likely
3893,"I visiting Boca Chica, Brownsville &amp; Texas in general! Thanks for all your support!!"
3894,Getting close
3895,"Yes, coming soon"
3896,Oh that would be fun. Will see.
3897,Joe Mode is the best mode
3898,Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!!
3899,Wise words from Gary the Bot
3900,"However, we wont customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense."
3901,Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally secs if you use Apple Pay at .
3902,"Exactly! Weve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide."
3903,"Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we dont raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
3904,"Thats not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why Im looking into it"
3905,"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
3906,"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
3907,Agreed
3908,"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
3909,"There arent really meant to be Tesla incentives, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
3910,"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
3911,"Hopefully, next year"
3912,"Personally, I think the universe looks great for billion years, let alone"
3913,Sagan was awesome
3914,They used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your along the Thames River in London
3915,Haha exactly!
3916,Yes
3917,"Yes, thats exactly what I meant, Gary the Bot!"
3918,Tesla commercial solar ordering now live at !
3919,At least they had great cigars
3920,Ahem
3921,A Speedraptor is a Velociraptor with no sense of direction (thats how you can them apart)
3922,This is technically a Speedraptor
3923,"Autopilot active crash prevention keeps getting better, as we examine every crash for improvement &amp; then upload smarter software. Ironically, I hope were never on the list!"
3924,v^2/r is fun haha
3925,"Makes it clear that you can only sense acceleration, not velocity"
3926,The downward spiral
3927,Good point
3928,To carry people
3929,Model S at Nrburgring has seats
3930,All great! Mel Brooks
3931,Spaceballs
3932,Flux capacitor option package
3933,Yes
3934,Soon
3935,"Yes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production &amp; applies to S,X &amp; Roadster, but not or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors."
3936,No
3937,The only thing beyond Ludicrous is Plaid
3938,A Flock of Bricks
3939,Next year
3940,Cuphead
3941,Of course
3942,Polytopia
3943,This could be good
3944,"But we probably wont try for best lap time this week, as we need to review &amp; tune Model S thoroughly for safety on Nrburgring, especially Flugplatz section"
3945,Model S is already there
3946,"Model S just set record for fastest door ever at Laguna Seca, video tmrw"
3947,DMT FTW
3948,Getting ready for flight of orbit-class Starship design
3949,Aargh!!
3950,"No, but that was an epic piece at a time when the word was being overrun by demented versions of an otherwise delightful jam container. It was like World War Z, but mason jars"
3951,Id love to
3952,obv
3953,For sure!
3954,sland
3955,Will be answered on th
3956,Exactly
3957,Looks good
3958,The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they wont fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.
3959,"The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
3960,"Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
3961,Precisely
3962,"Distance from fireball is *a*t^2, so if t is small, you havent moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, youll only travel ~0.03m in ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, youre prob ok."
3963,You know destination weather before departure &amp; theres no weather in space
3964,Everything happens so fast. Its such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels km in mins.
3965,"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
3966,"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but thats not indicative of capability."
3967,"Over time, &amp; are possible, but very difficult"
3968,Most likely
3969,Photoshop is amazing
3970,"Sea level Raptors vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle"
3971,For sure
3972,Actually true
3973,"Ceres, Callisto, Ganymede &amp; Titan"
3974,And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
3975,Deep lore
3976,Hoping to open in Romania soon!
3977,Definitely
3978,Probability that were in base Polytopia is highly unlikely - KWM
3979,Wow cool
3980,Why arent more people talking about this!?
3981,Sounds about right
3982,Its not
3983,"Over time, it will be % sustainable"
3984,Hadouken!!
3985,"Offer me money, offer me power"
3986,Also
3987,"Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!)"
3988,"For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains."
3989,Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.
3990,"Very exciting to see Indias rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall."
3991,Yes
3992,"Thanks for offering! Sure, that would be great."
3993,We might be in one right now
3994,"No, probably V10.1"
3995,"Merging code branches &amp; one more QA-level release this week. Hopefully, EAP wide release week after."
3996,"Looking good. Smart summon is almost great. Drive-in theater mode, caraoke &amp; Cuphead are awesome."
3997,For sure on first crewed missions for exactly that reason
3998,"Wanted to build an electric car company in college. Was going to do PhD at Stanford in electric energy storage (ultracaps), but got distracted for a few years by the Internet."
3999,years ago
4000,November most likely
4001,Were almost there
4002,Tesla doing laps at Nerdburgering
4003,But Taycan does seem like a good car. Nrburgring track time is great.
4004,Sounds sweaty
4005,A Neuralink could increase this by several orders of magnitude
4006,Uh no
4007,"Legs, but this render isnt accurate"
4008,"In some of those, Im even funny"
4009,Model S on Nrburgring next week
4010,"Also, cars are called automobiles"
4011,Jalopnik not sharpest tool in shed
4012,"Um , this word Turbo does not mean what you think it does"
4013,Looking into it
4014,"Yes, and it irony"
4015,"Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week."
4016,Its up to &amp; as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.
4017,"Same, except where limited by EU regulations. Were aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this &amp; are working with EU regulators to address."
4018,"In close traffic, poisonous gas spewing from the car in front of you goes straight into your AC intake. Good thing gas/diesel carmakers didnt cheat on their emissions or wed be in real trouble"
4019,Nice
4020,Gasoline is designed to burn
4021,Anywhere insurance prices are high
4022,"Yeah, several. Smart Summon most significant."
4023,Both and buttons in V10.0
4024,Yup
4025,Yes
4026,Definitely
4027,"Try Tesla Insurance. Should be ~20% less than avg. Currently only in California, but expanding soon. Critical feedback much appreciated."
4028,Opening on /9
4029,Slowpoke! Didnt even finish his hypothesis
4030,Haha actually true
4031,So good!
4032,Exactly
4033,Coming soon. Version at latest.
4034,Yes
4035,Iceland for sure!
4036,"Very soon, sorry for the delay"
4037,"Aiming for km flight in Oct &amp; orbit attempt shortly thereafter. Starship update will be on Sept th, anniversary of SpaceX reaching orbit. Starship Mk will be fully assembled by that time."
4038,Probably to months. Were about to ship Raptor SN .
4039,Probably m for next gen system
4040,"Would love to, but import duties are extremely high, even for electric vehicles"
4041,Should be. Will fix.
4042,"Also, u can order online at in mins, have car delivered to ur doorstep &amp; return for full refund"
4043,Cant believe its been years since our first vertical landing!
4044,Core body diameter is m/30ft
4045,R2D2s Dad

4056,Hopefully next year
4057,Appears to be a wiring/connector issue
4058,Igniters need to be inspected. We will try again tomorrow same time.
4059,"Raptor uses dual redundant torch igniters. Better long-term, but more finicky in development."
4060,About mins from flight attempt
4061,Starhopper flight currently tracking to pm Texas time for m / ~500ft hover test
4062,"Finally, VR thats cool *and* sexy!"
4063,Oh behave u naughty planet
4064,Its quite robust
4065,Where are additional Superchargers most needed?
4066,Worlds first very large scale battery has worked out well
4067,"Yes, last flight for Hopper. If all goes well, it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor."
4068,Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
4069,"Agreed, thats the right future"
4070,Looks like Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
4071,Were working closely with EU regulators &amp; hope to clarify the timeline soon
4072,Ok
4073,Should be soon
4074,"If youre a utility or public utilities commission, please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment &amp; usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants!"
4075,"Yes, probably within next to months"
4076,Tesla is working hard to help stop global warming
4077,The Nude Scientist
4078,Looks like a wheel of cheese
4079,Ok
4080,"We need to complete internal QA testing for safety, which will hopefully be done in about weeks"
4081,Wow
4082,Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
4083,"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version with smart summon is in wide release, which is about to weeks away, depending on how early access goes"
4084,"Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar systems fusion reactor (the sun)."
4085,"True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky."
4086,"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
4087,"Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk has Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
4088,Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
4089,"Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is % that of Earth &amp; gravity is %, but doable for localized warming"
4090,Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
4091,"AF certification required an enormous amount of work. Its mostly design-review based, not flight-based."
4092,"Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters"
4093,"Initially Model , later Y"
4094,Looking forward to seeing Giga Shanghai soon Amazing work by Tesla China team &amp; support of authorities much appreciated!
4095,Not yet
4096,This is a great idea
4097,Um I ate most of it
4098,Cookie decorating contest with kids
4099,Converts about million tons of mass to energy every second
4100,"Great name! Wouldnt worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit Earth eventually &amp; we currently have no defense."
4101,"Dont know yet, but its important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so well make costs as low as possible"
4102,One click to order solar &amp; save ~$500/year in utility bills with no long-term contract (cancel anytime)
4103,Next year
4104,"With the new lower Tesla pricing, its like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious."
4105,Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think
4106,Which means a small corner of Texas (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire United States
4107,Gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches Earths surface
4108,In a few years
4109,"Yeah, legs are hydraulic pistons &amp; abdomen is the accumulator"
4110,Generates a *lot* of energy
4111,It is quite silly
4112,Meaning less than a century. But this would be pretty intense.
4113,"Aspirationally, decades"
4114,The sun is an immense thermonuclear explosion fyi
4115,Yes
4116,"Not saying it solves everything, mind you, but its a step in the right direction"
4117,"Yeah, the trick is opening &amp; closing the spacesuit helmet really fast"
4118,Stop hashtagging me
4119,Perhaps that one was too edgy
4120,Hashtags are an abomination
4121,"No, as better to vary thickness with vehicle height, but this is the right way to go for Boring Co tunnels reinforcement imo"
4122,Nuking Mars one T-shirt at a time
4123,Simulations all the way down
4124,"Trust me, it will be"
4125,"Hey babe, fancy a hot date ?"
4126,Its not boring
4127,Of course!
4128,T-shirt soon
4129,Guess I sort of am already
4130,Id play that game
4131,Nuke Mars!
4132,This isnt correct. Will address.
4133,Good conversation with head of FAA Space. Need a bit more hazard analysis &amp; should be clear to fly soon.
4134,Am talking to in a few hours
4135,"Stacking fairing &amp; tanks soon, then adding control fins, engines &amp; landing gear"
4136,That was my actual password at one point!
4137,Stop posting my password on twitter!
4138,Coming
4139,"Tesla audio engineers come from B&amp &amp; many other companies. They literally rq. Our system is highly programmable, so we keep improving it via OTA codec updates."
4140,Well take care of it
4141,Corporate Surrealism
4142,Not yet
4143,fyi
4144,heh heh
4145,True
4146,No but srsly dont do it
4147,Roughly
4148,Ok
4149,Possibly two weeks
4150,Try playing Powerglide in your Tesla at volume
4151,Working on upgrades to Sentry
4152,No plans to introduce air suspension on Model at this time
4153,"Watching a movie on Tesla V10.0 is great, in large part due to the sound system"
4154,Obviously needed
4155,He would our first openly goth president. I think this is very important.
4156,I support Yang
4157,When Opportunity knocks
4158,Passing fad. Like steam engines. They look cool in a museum.
4159,Because our universe is actually a microverse in a miniverse. We probably just power someones brake lights.
4160,"Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge"
4161,"Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes"
4162,"Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly . Even though Im immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build days/week, it still doesnt feel real."
4163,"Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B"
4164,"Powerwall doesnt need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels"
4165,Yes
4166,Between $100B and $10T
4167,Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
4168,For sure
4169,Yup
4170,Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
4171,Gas cars are so last-century!
4172,Priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with FSD
4173,"Were accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!"
4174,"Probably every to months, depending on how much progress we make"
4175,Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke!
4176,FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue
4177,Thanks for reminding me. Will rectify.
4178,Tons of fun!
4179,Tesla software V10 is lookin real good! Releasing to early access list soon
4180,Pot kettle
4181,"Dont know enough about Georges company, but it sounds like hes focused on a machine vision approach, which is the only general solution imo"
4182,"Yeah, George is a little nuts, but I like him &amp; he often has interesting things to say"
4183,No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
4184,"Wouldnt read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights."
4185,Thanks George!
4186,"Were working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesnt quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world."
4187,But actual road data is what matters most
4188,"Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is % safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident."
4189,"Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff"
4190,Well said!
4191,Ok
4192,Strangers in the Night
4193,Sure
4194,Rocket fairing falling from space (higher res)
4195,And really knows cars!
4196,Rocket fairing falls from space &amp; is caught by Ms Tree boat
4197,"Fairing caught, video posting soon"
4198,Hoping to catch the fairing in a few mins
4199,"Race to orbit by both teams, although a success by both in close proximity would be amazing &amp; each would count as a win"
4200,Details coming at Starship update
4201,"Not in current plans, but that may change"
4202,No
4203,"Vandenberg is great for polar orbits. Will still play an important role long-term, but %+ will be eastward."
4204,"Great progress by Starship Cape team. Started several months behind, but catching up fast. This will be a super fun race to orbit, moon &amp; Mars!"
4205,"So much drama &amp; good times too! Maybe worth a book one day, but would come at expense of &amp; &amp; ."
4206,Headed to Starship Cape Canaveral build site today
4207,Just left Starship Texas build site. Very proud of progress SpaceX team has made! Pics are of m dome rotation &amp; Starship airframe behind windbreak.
4208,Lyft/Uber/taxi drivers are expert Tesla advocates. Thanks for your support!!
4209,Yes
4210,Progress is accelerating
4211,Queen
4212,Teletub
4213,Workin on it. One of my boys maybe gonna make this here candy.
4214,am guity
4215,Its all about branding
4216,The best guide by far!
4217,Will Dojo to be the difference
4218,That is a great guide
4219,philosophically
4220,"His name is Eric, of course"
4221,Its about time I suppose
4222,Mad skillz
4223,Yes
4224,A US
4225,Fred Astaire &amp; Ginger Rogers
4226,True
4227,I Top Hat
4228,It finally almost doesnt suck
4229,all u can
4230,"Oh my, what a dashingly handsome hat you have!"
4231,The lost art of entomological haberdashery &amp; millinery
4232,I dare say that could use a nice
4233,"Yes, detailed review of the first orbital Starship, explaining the pros &amp; cons of each design decision"
4234,We are tiny
4235,"Very convincing! Ok, Boca it is. We should have Starship Mk1 with Raptors almost ready to fly by then."
4236,I wouldve been bankrupt too. Unlikely investors would have funded a second attempt.
4237,Relief
4238,"Ok, will discuss with team"
4239,Sure
4240,"Also, you can request any service from the Tesla phone app in under a minute"
4241,"August th, either at Cape Canaveral or Boca Chica"
4242,"That was our last chance to reach orbit. If it had failed, SpaceX would have died."
4243,Yes
4244,Will also be launching The Boring Company China on this trip
4245,Good idea
4246,Youre most welcome!
4247,Fates loves irony
4248,"For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes."
4249,Not sure. Will check with my team.
4250,"Im told import duties are extremely high (up to %), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable."
4251,"Orbital refilling is vital to humanitys future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first."
4252,Fixing
4253,Depot haha
4254,Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
4255,Never thought wed make it this far
4256,Ancient times
4257,Spooling up production line rapidly. Hoping to manufacture ~1000 solar roofs/week by end of this year.
4258,Tesla Megapack now available for utility-scale energy storage
4259,"Thanks Jason! Super proud to work with such great teams at SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and Boring!!"
4260,Falcon rocket reentry from space with double sonic booms
4261,"Now that Hopper has flown, Starship update probably in two weeks or so."
4262,Falcon piercing the sound barrier on reentry
4263,Thanks for letting me know
4264,You can
4265,Vehicle alert seen show up automatically &amp; enable single touch request for service for that item either from the car screen or mobile app
4266,System automatically selects between mobile service &amp; service center appointment. Say prefer mobile in comments to bias. We will add a check box for mobile preferred.
4267,Tesla owners can schedule service appointments in under a minute just using their Tesla phone app!
4268,"Were working on it. Agreed, Minecraft is high priority. Roblox too."
4269,Sure
4270,Haha probably true (sigh)
4271,"Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August"
4272,Tesla Service Centers &amp; a lot more Superchargers coming to Poland later this year
4273,Will recognize &amp; read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights &amp; stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
4274,"Hoping to get Joe Mode into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting Joe Mode would lower the volume of strident beeps &amp; chimes by half."
4275,"If not immediately, will be followed shortly in a point release"
4276,Yes
4277,Some
4278,"Not currently in V10, but will try"
4279,"Yes, V10 will include several games &amp; infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light &amp; stop sign recognition &amp; Smart Summon"
4280,Cant you just play though phone Bluetooth?
4281,"Were close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe to months."
4282,"Maybe August, not more than a few months"
4283,"Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound"
4284,"When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving"
4285,"Ability to stream YouTube &amp; Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats &amp; surround sound audio."
4286,"Yes, really enjoyed it, although wish shed made it up to sky city"
4287,"Unity port is done, so finessing the controls now. Mostly limited by local storage. Will allow additional game storage via USB. Whatevers most fun!"
4288,And those who werent expecting a ternary joke
4289,Will run v high res at fps. Cuphead doesnt need k.
4290,Cuphead for Tesla coming out in August
4291,Space fairies are real
4292,Frank Frazetta
4293,Encounter in
4294,Drone cam
4295,Thanks!
4296,Engine cam
4297,Yes
4298,m hop in a week or two
4299,Starhopper flight successful. Water towers *can* fly haha!!
4300,"Btw, you can schedule service via the Tesla app in less than a minute"
4301,Good point. Getting fixed
4302,Probably /4 to /2 of that capacity would be for stationary storage
4303,Launch underway
4304,"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"
4305,Pc (chamber pressure) high due to colder than expected propellant
4306,Thin tiles on windward side of ship &amp; nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
4307,"Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe."
4308,Wearing black not recommended
4309,"High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you arent hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective."
4310,One Space Station image for each visit
4311,Me too
4312,"In a million years, the Universe will go from being to billion years old. Like tears in the rain"
4313,Exciting modes!
4314,True
4315,Time to face reality
4316,Were all just made of two quarks &amp; a lepton
4317,Center engines gimbal to degrees
4318,"For engine config, are mounted outboard under landing leg fairings"
4319,"Outer engines stick out slightly from m diameter, dont gimbal &amp; are mechanically joined at nozzle"
4320,tough
4321,"To be clear: good for in-space transit, but not recommended for Earth to orbit!"
4322,Very unlikely
4323,Goodbye
4324,Nuclear thermal rocket for fast transit around solar system would be a great area of research for
4325,Do EV owners use V to G a lot in Australia?
4326,"Probably have slots for up to engines, but can decontent as needed. Starship update after Hopper hover."
4327,I am become meme
4328,Dance Dance
4329,Next years competition will be in a km vacuum tunnel with a curve
4330,Woohoo
4331,"Orbital refilling is critical for high payload to moon or Mars. Initially just Starship to Starship, later dedicated tankers."
4332,means cute water
4333,Odd
4334,New top speed of km/h!!
4335,Just saw that on a T-shirt competition
4336,"Technically, alcohol is a solution"
4337,"Full stack is rn, but kinda beggin for just one more"
4338,Way too long
4339,Starship Super Heavy with Raptors
4340,I have the t-shirt
4341,Wont change. Starship launch structure will be attached to the other side from tower.
4342,Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
4343,to months after that
4344,It *is* vision
4345,I suspect many besides SpaceX will livestream these flights. Wont be subtle.
4346,Texas and Florida Starship prototypes (not Hopper) fly in to months
4347,Made with rain
4348,Coming soon
4349,Yes
4350,Tesla Service Centers &amp; Superchargers are being opened as fast as possible across Eastern Europe
4351,"This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket &amp; space station technology. Great respect."
4352,"No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot"
4353,"Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as youd expect."
4354,Maybe end of next year
4355,Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
4356,"Post test fuel leak, but no major damage"
4357,Aiming for hover test next week
4358,"Yeah, big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!"
4359,"This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features"
4360,Good piece
4361,I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer. Our new Raven powertain &amp; adaptive damping suspension is great! Next is Model P &amp; then X if driving with my kids. Acceleration is fun on tap!
4362,"Exactly. There is no MSRP, only P."
4363,With anything online
4364,Rococo Basilisk
4365,"yes, security is extremely important"
4366,Sure
4367,"Thoughtful analysis. We will endeavor to provide the robots, chips &amp; software to academia."
4368,Neuralink surprise twist!
4369,Is there a longer edit I can post?
4370,I think so
4371,"Something like this is the best way to do it. Incent outcome, not path."
4372,About to go live
4373,Not easy getting a lightsaber into backpack
4374,Approximately km/s
4375,SpaceX has Area
4376,"Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP"
4377,"If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more. Gen Shinseki"
4378,"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit."
4379,Probably
4380,Agreed. Thats approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
4381,Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August
4382,"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a . FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you cant make enough of them &amp; we wont be able to."
4383,"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
4384,"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"
4385,Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.
4386,Presentation streaming live from at pm Pacific
4387,Streaming. Check Neuralink website later today. Starts around pm.
4388,"Wont be today, hopefully tomorrow"
4389,"Sure, will do"
4390,"This guy is not a cofounder of Neuralink. Was at company briefly, but he didnt work out."
4391,"We are tiny, simple creatures"
4392,RIP
4393,Um yes
4394,Grahams number
4395,To Infinity and Beyond!
4396,SpaceX thruster package will be subtle. Hidden behind license plate.
4397,Haha yes
4398,"Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers."
4399,"Yeah, thats next after summon"
4400,"Will trace back inertial measurements &amp; wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off"
4401,"Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year"
4402,Probably mph or km/h
4403,Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
4404,Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
4405,"Agreed, its a small, but important, feature"
4406,Ok
4407,"Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs"
4408,Take note
4409,"About right, but dangerously chuggy &amp; risking bad things at %. Well keep it above % for this flight."
4410,"More like to mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is *v*sin /2, as I recall, but doesnt matter, as theres no geo anywhere near that mass."
4411,"mT to mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never."
4412,Cont of main
4413,We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
4414,~20m up &amp; sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully km up in a few months.
4415,Sure
4416,Raptor engine mounted on Starhopper. Aiming for hover test Tues.
4417,Great team
4418,Motor Trend awards Tesla Model S best Car of the Year ever in their year history!!
4419,"Its Not a Flamethrower, Mr Escobar"
4420,Sure
4421,Exactly
4422,The is moving at ~25 times the speed of sound &amp; orbits the Earth every minutes
4423,Ok
4424,"Absolutely agree, you should be allowed to move your Tesla anywhere in the world, unless its prevented by government rules. Thanks for letting me know."
4425,Feeling extra button
4426,Done. Im feeling &amp; Im feeling navigation buttons coming with next software release.
4427,Whoop Whoop!!
4428,I think so. Will check.
4429,Would be cool if car took you to a random fun place traveled to by other Tesla owners in the area
4430,Sigh
4431,The answer is always aliens
4432,Nice
4433,I have over the years
4434,That was a real sign
4435,"I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably, some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for years."
4436,True
4437,Exactly
4438,No
4439,No
4440,"There is no refreshed Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production months ago."
4441,This shampoo sounds amazing
4442,No problem
4443,The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites. More on this later.
4444,!freespace
4445,May the light of consciousness shine bright
4446,"Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising."
4447,Exactly
4448,Sure
4449,"To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car"
4450,"Between first development engine &amp; first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware &amp; software. Over time, thousands."
4451,Upgrading to kW soon
4452,"Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to % safety."
4453,Local supporters will be invited!
4454,Yes
4455,~Q4
4456,"End of Q4, most likely"
4457,"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality wont diverge until Q4, as its limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
4458,This is why its possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars
4459,All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer
4460,Starship Mk &amp; Hopper
4461,Wrlq
4462,Agreed
4463,Later in life Bakunin is underappreciated
4464,Listening to Revolutions by Duncan Found this on a throw pillow
4465,"Will do Starship presentation a few weeks after Hopper hovers, so prob late July. If that timing works, free LJ chips for all present!"
4466,My D&amp char was NG
4467,Sounds like fun
4468,Occupy Mars
4469,Cat is out of the bag
4470,"Exciting progress in Boca! Hopper almost ready to hover. Based on tonights test, looks like Hz Raptor vibration problem is fixed."
4471,Sharknado is real
4472,When sheets come loose all dignity is lost
4473,Model X as it should be shown
4474,What ants must feel like
4475,Yeah
4476,Landing on Ms. Tree
4477,Rocket fairing returning from space
4478,"Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident &amp; do our best to minimize probability of recurrence."
4479,"We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth &amp; becoming multiplanetary via Mars. Its not clear how much time we have to do these things, but sooner is definitely better."
4480,Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians &amp; cyclists especially.
4481,Should be fixed soon
4482,Reason for top rating is that active steering &amp; braking safety features of Tesla Autopilot are turned on no cost for all cars
4483,Congratulations Tesla team &amp; thanks to all the new Tesla owners!!
4484,Sure
4485,Good one
4486,Meme of recursive irony
4487,Not often these days. Good way to spend time with kids though.
4488,Playing a little Polytopia. Gonna try Solaris w my boys.
4489,Death Note
4490,"Yeah, exactly"
4491,"Yep, order online at in mins &amp; car delivered direct to home"
4492,Is this true ?
4493,"FWIW, based on calcs I did years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over Wh/kg today, but probably exceed in ~5 years."
4494,"Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines"
4495,"Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves."
4496,Huge thanks to all Tesla supporters around the world helping the cause. We you!!
4497,Tweak music &amp; car karaoke
4498,"Fun, little music tool coming later"
4499,Sure. Want to add easy import/export of images from your phone.
4500,Thanks for the happy birthday wishes!
4501,"One day, there will be a little racing game in the racing game in the car"
4502,Merkindise coming soon!
4503,They have the best merkins
4504,Im such a bad public speaker! Damn.
4505,These do seem like wise words
4506,If only wed listened
4507,"But, if youre going to buy a merkin, be sure to haggle properly!"
4508,"If you dont already know what a merkin is, dont google it. You have been warned."
4509,Typing Merlin literally just autocorrected me to merkin
4510,"We poured our heart &amp; soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Faberg egg of cars."
4511,"Hardly anyone noticed, but still"
4512,We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
4513,Design &amp; production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible
4514,sec -60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
4515,Thats actually kinda true
4516,Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesnt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
4517,Youre touching on a good critique of Falcon . Our st stage to nd stage propellant ratio is too high. Were fixing that with Starship.
4518,"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disneys Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but youd exit on another continent."
4519,"~1000, as all seats would be coach &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be to mins. Its basically an ICBM traveling at Mach that lands."
4520,"About , assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
4521,"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low"
4522,There will be no Block . Moving to Starship architecture.
4523,"Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
4524,"Good to see this. Splitting interstage into sections will have some challenges, but could work."
4525,Probably sooner
4526,Ok
4527,"Sure, that would be an honor"
4528,Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
4529,High entry force &amp; heat breached engine bay &amp; center engine TVC failed
4530,"Ok, thanks"
4531,Working on Tesla global logistics
4532,I know sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
4533,"Yes, but we couldnt take a chance on nd stage failing its th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything Im aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well."
4534,Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
4535,High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
4536,Center core RUD. It was a long shot.
4537,He was the real deal
4538,One of our main conference rooms at SpaceX is named after Goddard
4539,"No, its along the way"
4540,Colonizing Mars one mug at a time!
4541,Waiting for Falcon Heavy to launch means high cortisol levels. This is our toughest rocket launch ever.
4542,Yeah
4543,Heat will breathe life into Mars
4544,Yes! I love botanical gardens. This is my favorite:
4545,Absolutely
4546,"Yeah, that sounds ideal! I love the KSC rocket garden. Spent many days there looking at rocket design details."
4547,Uh oh
4548,Ok
4549,"On Mars, I like to drink my coffee in this mug"
4550,Chomsky is the Iago of socio-economic theory &amp; Piketty is his docile puppet
4551,Starship will do orbital launches from Boca Chica (near Brownsville) &amp; Cape
4552,"At Cape for launch, so watched on hotel screen, but still so beautiful"
4553,Just watched it from your link
4554,Yeah
4555,Apollo
4556,"Yes, the droids can now hold down the center core"
4557,"Odds of center core surviving are about % imo, as its coming in about times faster than a rifle bullet"
4558,Tesla Software Engineering
4559,Falcon Heavy on LC-39A
4560,"All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms"
4561,Its a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
4562,"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
4563,"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about bar more"
4564,Merlin could probably do flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
4565,So cool
4566,Anything with high contrast
4567,Excessive shades of grey
4568,"Yeah, weve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous."
4569,"Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps."
4570,Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
4571,Haha
4572,Depends on destination
4573,"Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to mT level"
4574,"Since Raptor produces tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."
4575,Chomsky sucks
4576,"Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite"
4577,Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
4578,"More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven"
4579,"Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so /year. Still, non-trivial at tons of thrust/year."
4580,"Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every hours by end of year."
4581,"For sure moon st, as its only days away &amp; u dont need interplanetary orbital synchronization"
4582,Moon too

4593,"A few other small things change, but pretty close"
4594,Tesla is putting significant resources into high-efficiency battery recycling. Makes both environmental &amp; economic sense. Please consider joining if interested in recycling engineering!
4595,"No, were already recycling them"
4596,"Yes, demographics, stratified by age, will look like an upside down pyramid with many old people &amp; fewer young"

4602,"Exactly. And many areas of countries showing good Internet actually have poor or no access, so those are important to address too."
4603,One of my favorite original Roadster colors!
4604,How about baby pink?
4605,Reminder that US federal tax drops by $1875 for any Tesla delivered after June . Order online at .
4606,"Changing the palette is hell on service, because cars last for years. Every color change has a long tail of hurt, especially for Model ."

4620,My chariot license is made of papyrus!
4621,Thats the Tesla part
4622,Overall master plan should be explained. I think it still makes sense if we dont consider AI b other.
4623,Ive been tweeting strange shit since Ramses II. He was a great pharaoh!
4624,Might get pushed to next month. Starhopper flight first. Waiting on engine repair.
4625,"years ago, SpaceX server room was named Skynet as a joke. Fate irony."
4626,Thanks
4627,Model arriving in UK
4628,Good question. Will consider thoughtful response.
4629,By far
4630,"Good analysis. Both computers will be used &amp; sync ~20 times per second. This is a long time to a computer. Like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one."
4631,Falcon Rising
4632,BG2 was so good
4633,"No need, Top Gear already did"
4634,The Ass Blade of Vengeance!
4635,Weird that this actually happened. Music makes a big difference.

4637,"Truth is a metaphorical concept with no footwear or clothing of anything kind. Also, baby dont hurt me haha"
4638,"Yes, excessively configurable seats almost always make things worse, rather than better. Too complex &amp; unwieldy."
4639,"Cool, thats the way it should be!"
4640,Cant fool me it was
4641,Sounds about right
4642,Dont make me challenge you to a rap battle!!
4643,Fair point
4644,"Yeah, dual motor AWD is super fun!"
4645,RWD with all-weather tires works great. Tesla traction control is an order of magnitude more precise than gas/diesel. Really helps to have Newton &amp; Maxwell on your side.
4646,Thanks Bob! He is a tough critic.
4647,"Not only was the paint without any discernible flaw, but the various panels formed a body of precision that was beyond reproach"

4662,Fear (and memes) get clicks
4663,"Storm Watch was active for hundreds of Powerwall customers this weekend as a result of Red Flag Fire Warnings in California, and we will continue to activate it whenever there advance awareness of a potential power outage or physical danger"
4664,Absolutely agree. Major expansion of service centers underway.
4665,Super fair criticism. Were putting max resources on this. Hard to hire enough repair technicians in Norway! Please apply if interested.
4666,Norway
4667,"Good point. Maybe we could collect rainwater, add a little antifreeze in cold climates &amp; make it last for years."
4668,Annual tire rotation is actually optional. Only worthwhile if you see significant differential wear on inside vs outside of tire.
4669,Yes
4670,Upcoming Falcon Heavy &amp; details
4671,China EV subsidies mostly end this month &amp; fully end in about months
4672,Yes
4673,No problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline. Its great to get thoughtful criticism.
4674,"mph is common on the Autobahn. Even with only offramp tunnels, exit speed drops to mph."
4675,Tesla Superchargers &amp; service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year
4676,"Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings"
4677,"Avg speed of NY Subway is actually mph. TBC loop can run at mph with pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. Thats /hour/lane &amp; you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput &amp; convenience."
4678,Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them.
4679,Exactly
4680,"Were trying to simplify product complexity, so only offering white (technically black &amp; white) interior in high volume markets"

4690,Same
4691,Not enough room unless we completely delete front trunk. Model S &amp; X primary HEPA filter alone is literally % bigger than normal car air filter.
4692,S/X HEPA filter is one of my favorite features
4693,Model Performance
4694,Feedback received. Restoring white interior.
4695,Thats the idea
4696,Thoughtful model
4697,"Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further"
4698,Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto &amp; oil companies arent known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors &amp; space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
4699,"Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach ."
4700,"Add to more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result."
4701,Wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). Doesnt affect schedule much though.
4702,Not bad
4703,Exactly. Were on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
4704,"Yeah, the fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights"
4705,I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
4706,"One days grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow."
4707,Edgy move
4708,Good idea
4709,True. Im a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
4710,Yup
4711,Would love to do exactly that
4712,"Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. Well get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun."
4713,"Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, well make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
4714,Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
4715,"Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy."
4716,"Aiming for sub ms latency initially, sub ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers"
4717,"If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, thats easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map."
4718,"There are already satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink wont be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible."
4719,"No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."
4720,Fair
4721,Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
4722,Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
4723,"Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
4724,"Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. Isp &amp; up to % thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."
4725,Whoa cool
4726,Yes
4727,Beautiful solar sail
4728,ISS is extremely gigantic &amp; has lights
4729,"Precisely, sats will be in darkness when stars are visible"
4730,Exactly
4731,Karma
4732,Bold move
4733,Stop sending me this tron - Audi
4734,Great ad
4735,This is complete nonsense
4736,Exactly. A car being electric &amp; upgradable to full self-driving maximizes future resale value.
4737,Its not my finest work
4738,"Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. Consumers are starting to realize this."
4739,"Krypton thrusters operative, satellites initiating orbit raise every mins"
4740,No
4741,Absolutely
4742,"Yes, to months"
4743,Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
4744,Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
4745,Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
4746,"Opposite is true: you can have s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below"
4747,"Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesnt matter"
4748,"Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!"
4749,Paperwork &amp; hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
4750,"LA has a subway, but most people dont know about it"
4751,That would great!
4752,Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. Its optional!
4753,Boring Company guide to why tunnels are awesome &amp; safest place to be in an earthquake
4754,"So far, so good"
4755,"Ironically, same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value and imply Tesla is worthless. They cant *both* be true!"
4756,Gary the still crushes us! Wouldnt be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
4757,Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
4758,This is simple and just works
4759,Pretty much
4760,Racing at mph in a tunnel under LA

4765,Launch in mins
4766,"New S &amp; X are much improved. Worth trying out. Youre on version , current S/X is version ."
4767,Its smart *and* enhanced!
4768,Smart Summon coming soon!
4769,"Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX, looking at rocket"
4770,"Part of the factory is being upgraded, but tours will continue around the parts that arent"
4771,"Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full."
4772,Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
4773,~2.8m
4774,"Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber."
4775,Horizontally
4776,"First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around ."
4777,So it goes
4778,months
4779,"Hopefully, months"
4780,Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
4781,"Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees"
4782,Sure
4783,Two tunnels about a mile long each
4784,Yes
4785,"Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, youd have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!"
4786,"Aiming for tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least tons, allowing for mass growth"
4787,N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
4788,"Hoping for sec Isp, but at least . Otherwise similar to sea level version."
4789,Aspirationally
4790,"sea level optimized Raptors, vacuum optimized Raptors (big nozzle)"
4791,"After the GoT finale, we dropped it to"
4792,"Mk1 &amp; Mk2 ships at Boca &amp; Cape will fly with at least engines, maybe all"
4793,"About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every days this summer"
4794,Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in months. Aiming to finish by end of year.
4795,"The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer &amp; impellers."
4796,"But, essentially, the spinning things"
4797,Yes
4798,"Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower."
4799,Did it for the memes
4800,Coming soon
4801,"Yeah, been thinking about it for a long time. Electric supersonic VTOL. Hard problem."
4802,Hopefully in about days
4803,Physics favors full flow
4804,Good design imo
4805,Thanks Sam!
4806,Good piece on lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles
4807,Sorry to hear that. Will fix.
4808,Ok
4809,Easy to turn one of our Starlink satellites into a debris collector
4810,Yes
4811,Almost ready. Im testing it personally this weekend.
4812,Yes
4813,Also porting Unreal Engine
4814,Nintendo wont let us
4815,"Maybe so eventually, but it will be information &amp; entertainment, not trickery"
4816,"Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead, we use that money to make the product great."
4817,We def need racing game using actual car steering wheel &amp; pedals!
4818,Sure
4819,Of course
4820,Portal &amp; on this would rock
4821,Would be great to have &amp; !
4822,"Interact with games via touchscreen, steering wheel buttons &amp; XBox/PS controllers"
4823,Lots more games coming once we finish porting Unity!
4824,Top Secret
4825,"It technically could, but wouldnt have enough mass margin for a heat shield, landing propellant or legs, so not reusable"
4826,"No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives &amp; forks are made of."
4827,"Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels"
4828,Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways.
4829,This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S &amp; X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters.
4830,"Yeah, feels like something is messed up with Apple news app. Almost only ever shows negative news. Nickname is the hate stream"
4831,Congrats on many successful launches!
4832,And I am forever grateful
4833,Set of all math jokes that are actually funny is pretty small (sigh)
4834,"Physics demands the impedance of resistance, because its not real"
4835,What makes resistance complex is that its half imaginary!
4836,Glad it worked out
4837,Congratulations &amp; on creating great open source literacy software!
4838,"more launches of for initial activation, for significant coverage"
4839,"Starlink mission will be heaviest payload ever at tons. If all goes well, each launch of satellites will generate more power than Space Station &amp; deliver terabit of bandwidth to Earth."
4840,Thats about right
4841,Probably start installing end of next month
4842,"SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10."
4843,"The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other, but other team not required to use them."
4844,Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both.
4845,SpaceX is doing simultaneous competing builds of Starship in Boca Chica Texas &amp; Cape Canaveral Florida
4846,"A lot, but you cant count on lines"
4847,Exactly
4848,Its a factor
4849,GoT season finale leaked
4850,"Technically, his bro"
4851,Happy Mothers Day. I love you Mom!
4852,Ok
4853,Completely agree. Every Tesla should have good art &amp; music creation software.
4854,It is flat-packed. No dispenser.
4855,That *might* not be my lucky number
4856,"More details on day of launch, currently tracking to Wednesday"
4857,"Much will likely go wrong on st mission. Also, more launches of sats needed for minor coverage, for moderate."
4858,"These are production design, unlike our earlier Tintin demo sats"
4859,"If static fire on Mon, on Tues"
4860,First Starlink satellites loaded into Falcon fairing. Tight fit.
4861,Ok
4862,u3k
4863,Exactly
4864,Yes
4865,"Yes, they are!"
4866,Will try it
4867,We have dogs &amp; cat. Dogs jump in car no problem. Cat does not. Experiment concluded.
4868,"Cats, probably not tbh"
4869,Truth
4870,"How about Future is driving you, followed by the word future several times in decreasing font size?"
4871,By Spiderwee on Artstation
4872,How about being able to look through any of the cameras?
4873,Sure
4874,Thats how I feel when I see dabbing
4875,. drives a Tesla across the loneliest road in America
4876,Probably June
4877,"Oh stop teasing, Jeff"
4878,But putting the word Blue on a ball is questionable branding
4879,Competition is good. Results in a better outcome for all.
4880,"We could have gamed an LA/NY Autopilot journey last year, but when we do it this year, everyone with Tesla Full Self-Driving will be able to do it too"
4881,That journey will have a diff age rating
4882,Latest Model S is slightly faster
4883,Basically begging for it
4884,Shoulda seen it coming
4885,Turns out theres more ways to use Autopilot than we imagined
4886,Soon
4887,Baby Thanos?
4888,Time
4889,Yes
4890,"Yeah, takes you to a big purple guy with a bejeweled gold glove"
4891,I was just there about a month ago
4892,Probably shouldnt have called holding company Cyberdyne Systems
4893,"Just behind the glovebox, which is, presumably, where the gloves are"
4894,"Hes just kidding, folks, but best to turn car off just in case. Also was years ago."
4895,Mein Herz brennt isboss fight song
4896,"Schatz, bitte hr auf- ich werde rot!"
4897,"Even though lease cost is lower, I recommend purchase, as buyer retains upside value of car vs lease where you have give it back to Tesla"
4898,"Model Standard Range+ with Autopilot lease is $399/month at , but lots of other EVs available:"
4899,Were closing the loop on Autobahn driving. Will improve dramatically in coming months. Ultra gemtlich.
4900,Oh. They have nice pictures there.
4901,There are people not on Twitter!? Where are they?
4902,Does look like fun
4903,Finnish Metal Rocks
4904,One of the biggest reusability improvements was fast leg stow. Version sometimes took days.
4905,"In recent years, hours were much higher. Dont recommend though bad for health &amp; happiness. But no choice or Tesla would die. Hope to reduce to hours next year."
4906,Been wanting to go ever since that Finnish metal band won

4915,"Wow, how did they take this video!?"
4916,Yes
4917,Looks about light-minutes away
4918,Relatively speaking
4919,"Space is easy, orbit is hard"
4920,"SpaceX needs to demonstrate more progress with Starship, but that will hopefully happen rapidly"
4921,". support for reusability with high reliability, the critical breakthrough for orbital rockets, has made a big difference"
4922,Will consider
4923,To air is human
4924,"Sorry for the inconvenience. Were aware of this glitch &amp; its fixed, but software updates wait for a WiFi connection. Policy has been changed to push updates like this over cell connection sooner."
4925,Close
4926,"Just kidding (obv), but the Fermi Paradox is bizarre"
4927,Maybe theyre among us. Just saying maybe
4928,Yeah definitely

4931,Thats a direct quote from Warren Buffett
4932,Also times more fun!
4933,Later this month. We need to merge a lot of updates into main code branch.

4935,Margaritaville is one of my fav songs
4936,True
4937,Youre welcome. Thanks for buying a Tesla!
4938,Only if unable to order by May
4939,Here you go
4940,Ok
4941,Maybe this goat is available
4942,Changing Tesla horn sound to
4943,Sigh
4944,"Yeah, weird"
4945,Good question
4946,What should be developed on Ethereum?
4947,"Of M futures, M were simply death by boredom"
4948,Naturally Ramanujan
4949,How many futures are there actually?
4950,Stop giving away free ETH!
4951,And yet people ask what could possibly go wrong with AI

4955,Excellent analysis
4956,Deepfake
4957,OG wisdom
4958,Malcolm new book is
4959,Starships on Mars
4960,Yes
4961,Damn haters
4962,Starship on the moon
4963,Our competitors do
4964,We dont buy advertising
4965,Wheres the proof!?
4966,Genau
4967,Might be boring
4968,Physics is a set of compression functions for the simulation
4969,Its pretty much the only theory. This will mess with your mind:
4970,Sensors are for the weak. Just go open loop.
4971,So true
4972,As sure as night follows day
4973,Schrdinger is a probability distribution in the shape of a cat
4974,Any observation of Schrdinger changes Schrdinger
4975,"Once had a Great Dane named Hamlet, because Hamlet was a great Dane"
4976,The only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid!
4977,Thats them! Schrdinger is neither here nor there.
4978,Not as far as I know
4979,"We have a big dog called Gatsby, a little dog called Marvin the Martian &amp; a cat named Schrdinger"
4980,Yes
4981,"Quantum mechanics was harder than all my other courses combined, but so incredible"
4982,"NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs."
4983,I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
4984,"TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you cant transfer data fast enough between computer &amp; GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant."
4985,"Exactly, Tesla &amp; Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net"
4986,Were working on it. Takes time to get all regulatory approvals. Almost there for the larger US states. At least to months for Europe/UK.
4987,Certain regulatory agencies would beg to differ
4988,Haha yes
4989,"Its just me writing, so the foolish things I say are entirely my fault"
4990,"Only see about % of mentions. No deep logic to those I answer. Aspirationally useful, but often whimsical."
4991,"No, just preparing for untethered hover tests"
4992,"Tom is still an advisor to SpaceX, but semi-retired about years ago &amp; doesnt work on Raptor. Will Heltsley heads propulsion overall, but Raptor is a team effort. No single leader."
4993,Great work by Tesla China team &amp; supporting contractors!
4994,Hoping to cover all of Eastern Europe this year
4995,Yup
4996,Everyone knows
4997,Cramer is a simulation. Hes not real.
4998,Thats odd. Will look into it.
4999,UK order page will go live around May or
5000,We will delay $1k full self-driving option price increase until May for those unable to order by May
5001,"UK Model order page goes live next week, followed shortly thereafter by Japan, Australia, New Zealand &amp; Hong Kong"
5002,CleanTechnica summarizes new print cover story
5003,Haha
5004,"Will be sentient, of course"
5005,Range will be above km
5006,"Agreed, were ramping up service centers &amp; Tesla mobile service worldwide"
5007,"More like $1000, but varies by country due to big differences in tax"
5008,Considering
5009,"As mentioned before, Tesla full self-driving option price will increase after May . You can order online at ."
5010,Like blowing twigs too?
5011,Nope
5012,Motor Trend on Model S updates
5013,Model S drives from San Francisco to Los Angeles without recharging
5014,Strange but true
5015,This require hardware
5016,Can order online in mins for home delivery &amp; return in days for full refund
5017,New Model S has mile / km range
5018,Perhaps the Internet has some helpful suggestions?
5019,Cant think of anything
5020,Someone else thought of an electric blower first? What!?
5021,Tesla blows haha
5022,We can probably just repurpose Model HVAC parts. Not a big deal.
5023,True
5024,Long lasting battery + fast recharge &gt; pack swap
5025,Haha ok
5026,"Its been suggested by many, externally &amp; internally"
5027,Arent there good ones already?
5028,Maybe add a particulate filter on inlet
5029,"Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower"
5030,"Yeah, there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed, Fred. Hello."
5031,Will do
5032,Absolutely
5033,Seriously
5034,"Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez"
5035,"Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EVs have high fire risk when opposite is true."
5036,"Thanks, support super appreciated"
5037,Sad if true
5038,"When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe theres a good reason that isnt obvious."
5039,"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over % *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
5040,"Over a million combustion engine (its right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
5041,"Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for -12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers + years late. Why the double standard?"
5042,Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between years &amp; never
5043,Anti-matter def wins on energy density
5044,"Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year."
5045,"As a robotaxi, probably closer to hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed."
5046,Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone
5047,Anyone who did this analysis should interview at Tesla
5048,Upgrading hardware is not important for a few months
5049,Is that a real billboard?
5050,Well let the NN loose on Track Mode one day thatll be insane
5051,Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark
5052,Or maybe pegging
5053,"On yeah, that too"
5054,"Exactly. Also, you cant actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds."
5055,Full Self-Driving video
5056,All Model s ever made can upgrade
5057,"Warning, this presentation is hrs &amp; mins long"
5058,Exactly
5059,All cars made since Oct either have the hardware needed for FSD or are trivially upgradeable
5060,"Yeah, will post soon"
5061,Its automatic
5062,Tesla Full Self-Driving
5063,Happy Home Planet Day!
5064,Full Metal Alchemy

5068,Already have one
5069,Respawn++
5070,The Internet is insane
5071,"Never seen anything like it. Tesla is just trying to make electric cars &amp; solar power for a better future for all. True, we might not succeed, but why do they want us to fail?"
5072,"Milady, my shield is yours"
5073,"This is extremely messed up. , whats going on?"
5074,FTW
5075,We are very tiny

5096,"propellant grade kerosene (basically, jet fuel) &amp; liquid oxygen are close, but H2 &amp; O2 are not"
5097,Common shaft only works if optimal rpm is similar for fuel &amp; oxidizer

5105,Are you good with sheep?
5106,Im an absolute unit too
5107,"Yeah, gave everything I had to Tesla in Dec"
5108,"Its not a big deal. Charge to % to % &amp; youll be fine. At % state of charge, regen braking doesnt work, because the battery is full, so car is less energy efficient."
5109,Haha
5110,Yes
5111,Rockets are not yet safe enough to fly over land
5112,"Engines seem ok, pending inspection"
5113,"It can, but the attachment fixtures are different from standard F9 &amp; they werent ready in time"
5114,Winter in snowfall is so beautiful
5115,Im actually less crazy in person or am I?
5116,I was always crazy on Twitter fyi
5117,Yes
5118,Haha true. I actually love horses.
5119,Buying a car in that cant upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in
5120,Love Just Water btw
5121,"With steel membrane wings like a Dragon, we may be able to lower Starships orbital reentry temp to ~1000 degrees C, which would allow the whole surface to be uncooled bare metal"
5122,Starship will land on a ring of fire
5123,Yes
5124,Winter is coming
5125,Thinking about adding giant stainless steel dragon wings to Starship
5126,"That tweet did take immense effort Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps."
5127,Deal
5128,Please support my campaign to rebrand as emoji!
5129,"At some point, and I should just a get a room"
5130,Just use this handy guide
5131,Yes
5132,Good interview by
5133,Truth
5134,Exactly
5135,How embarrassing. Will change.
5136,We will. You read it right.
5137,Haha true
5138,Ive always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
5139,"Good point, small oil is a problem too"
5140,"Im sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They cant *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expos pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps theyre all angels"
5141,"Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false."
5142,"True, Bloomberg is almost as bad"
5143,Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock puppets of big oil
5144,Starship is kinda Gundam
5145,"Very much so. There are B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing % of that fleet would require making M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over k cars in next months, but thats a mere % of M or % of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply."
5146,"Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesnt have access to the video unless sent to us by owner."

5150,"Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop."
5151,"Wow, a lot of people dont know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First -12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve."
5152,"There is GWh/yr theoretical capacity, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
5153,Yes
5154,"Yes, all cars with Autopilot or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date"
5155,"Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesnt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability"
5156,Yes
5157,"There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase"
5158,"Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
5159,Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
5160,Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla wont spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to GWh theoretical.
5161,Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
5162,Something like that
5163,Starting May
5164,Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time
5165,Coming this year
5166,Lease a Tesla online in a few mins &amp; have it delivered to your house (return within days for full refund)
5167,Cryptocurrency is my safe word
5168,Model drive unit &amp; body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last k to k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.
5169,Cool
5170,"On April , Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car"
5171,Uh its a simulation hello
5172,Da Vinci biography
5173,Malala
5174,That would be cool to do one day
5175,Other automakers change prices constantly &amp; substantially by varying rebates &amp; discounts according to negotiating strength of buyer. Tesla is transparent &amp; consistent.
5176,"So if we raise prices in the future, will you cut Tesla a check? Cant have it both ways."
5177,Ahem RHD
5178,LHD order page should be live within a few weeks. Deliveries start hopefully June/July.
5179,Coming this year
5180,Good point
5181,Leasing now available for Model
5182,Samwise
5183,Am basically doing continuous AMA on Twitter!
5184,"This is true. They each have avionics, several nitrogen thrusters &amp; steerable parachutes."
5185,SpaceX team
5186,Made on Earth by humans
5187,Yes
5188,"Recovered from water, but undamaged"
5189,Both fairing halves recovered. Will be flown on Starlink mission later this year.
5190,Thanks on behalf of team! We !
5191,Liquid oxygen
5192,The Falcons have landed
5193,. team would be so honored to fly this for !
5194,Haha exactly
5195,Upper atmospheric wind shear is very high. Will have to postpone launch unless weather improves soon.
5196,Vengeance
5197,Haha sure sounds like it
5198,Probably something notable to announce in a few months
5199,"I hope a cybernetic interface is ready in time. Symbiosis, irrelevance (hopefully blissful) or doom seem to be the three most likely paths."
5200,Actually true
5201,Found a pic
5202,"First flight for Falcon Heavy Block means there is some risk of failure between % to % imo. Many good design improvements from Falcon Heavy demo, but the changes are unproven."
5203,I first read this as making wind with
5204,Norway has already proven it could be done last month. No question Australia could do this in far fewer than years.
5205,. copy
5206,"No, its better"
5207,"Building primary structure completion seems on track for May, but then it will take several months to install &amp; activate factory equipment"
5208,Love Brunel. Great first name too.
5209,Yes
5210,Mobile can do it no problem
5211,"Doesnt matter yet whether you have Tesla FSD computer or Tesla Nvidia-based computer. When it does matter later this year, Tesla will switch the computers for you."
5212,What city?
5213,"Two, independent system-on-chip architecture, with each SoC having two NN accelerators that can perform simultaneous health-check calculations to protect against a soft error"
5214,Yes. Working through regulatory approvals.
5215,The Tesla Full Self-Driving Computer now in production is at about % compute load for these tasks or % with full fail-over redundancy
5216,Time flies
5217,Any user input counts
5218,Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability &gt;&gt; human.
5219,It will enable video when parked &amp; connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.
5220,Youre welcome. Thanks for your great photos!
5221,"Yeah, Id love to do that"
5222,Starhopper
5223,Good idea
5224,Definitely
5225,Already fixed
5226,To make core AP more affordable
5227,That would be cool. Color variation causes havoc though.
5228,"Team is working on international versions super hard btw. Unfortunately, regulators around the world have different rules &amp; processes, so just takes time."
5229,Tesla Enhanced Summon coming out in US next week for anyone with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option
5230,Precisely
5231,Almost done
5232,Are you on Mad Max Mode? This may be too meek for places like the LA Freeway
5233,Radar
5234,Sure
5235,Exactly
5236,"Base AP will have same NN, so core functionality also improves"
5237,Many different regulatory authorities. Just takes time.
5238,Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.
5239,Starhopper just lifted off &amp; hit tether limits!
5240,Max thrust of tons will be almost % higher than Falcon Heavy demo mission last year
5241,"Static fire data looks good so far. This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block , so were being extra cautious. Launch date might move."
5242,Exactly
5243,"drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for % of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance."
5244,Hi Nina! So how many would it take? Just between us.
5245,Stay positive
5246,Good point
5247,How much is it?
5248,"I think Ive paid for a subscription at least three times, but your paywall keeps forgetting this"
5249,"Please fix your paywall. Your content is great, but your paywall is not."
5250,Yes
5251,"Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars"
5252,Thats exactly the idea. Whats not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software &amp; going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April .
5253,Thanks
5254,Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed.
5255,Im told its looking positive &amp; we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
5256,Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
5257,Impressive analysis
5258,"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, well add a setting to disable internal camera."
5259,"Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through nd side windows &amp; rear window."
5260,"Its there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."
5261,Will take care of it
5262,Improvements coming soon
5263,"Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input."
5264,Great name
5265,Neural net is upgraded too in this release. Its not just a settings change.
5266,"Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup."
5267,Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.
5268,Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!
5269,This is way more awesome than it might sound
5270,Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower &amp; allow below current % level. Making that adjustment too.
5271,Agreed
5272,Night mode with % brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that % brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.
5273,Change your screen preference from night mode to auto
5274,Fur-curious
5275,These rumors are untrue!
5276,"Responsible for more deaths than any other chemical! Weirdly, dihydrogen dixoxide, with only one extra oxygen, is not good to drink, but great for changing hair color."

5279,Dogecoin value may vary
5280,Dogecoin rulz
5281,Uh oh
5282,Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. Its pretty cool.
5283,Yup
5284,Some challenges with ice formation in the cryogenic propellant prevalves. Hopefully overcome soon.
5285,What could possibly go wrong?
5286,No
5287,Youre so right. Working on it!
5288,That car seemed so advanced when I watched that show as a kid! Knight Industries Two Thousand
5289,And even tinier ones for tardigrades
5290,Yes
5291,"Going forward, all Tesla stores will be tiny &amp; have tiny cars"

5306,Weve been so mired in production &amp; logistics for past months. Really looking fwd to getting Semi into production.
5307,Tesla Semi delivering Tesla cars
5308,Pre-Happy birthday!
5309,"Amazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe &amp; China! Most insane logistics challenge Ive ever seen. Thanks also to many country &amp; city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated."
5310,Coming soon!
5311,No
5312,Wow
5313,This might be my finest work
5314,Duck emoji defeats Emo G Records. Crushing victory.
5315,Im disappointed that my record label failed
5316,Emo G Records
5317,Instagram comments are coding in emojis
5318,Also true
5319,True
5320,The quality of emojis varies wildly
5321,Lame
5322,C++ syntax sucks
5323,"Assert (Money == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);"
5324,Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
5325,Like the movie Us. Scary but also empathetic.
5326,"No, but for sure the other way around!"
5327,"Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you cant hear, but you can feel in your chest"
5328,"Were going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey."
5329,"Annoying that perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy cant. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but thats very rare."
5330,"Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block has way more performance than last years vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
5331,"Probably no fairing either &amp; just Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, tons empty) with Isp of . Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR . Spread out, see whats there. Not impossible."
5332,"Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, its slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."
5333,Anyone who bought FSD will get it
5334,"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward HW3 will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."
5335,Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon .
5336,"Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow."
5337,"We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe theres an alien artifact out there"
5338,Super cool!
5339,Good point
5340,"Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate."
5341,"Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability."
5342,Exactly
5343,Super proud of Tesla Autopilot team!
5344,"No, it is one week either way."
5345,"I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo."
5346,It would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!
5347,lbs!? How puny. Do you construct childrens toys?
5348,Thats exactly it. Youre no longer mentally fatigued after a long drive. Makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long day.
5349,Good point
5350,Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it
5351,"Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but were going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads."
5352,Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.
5353,Thank you!
5354,Will do
5355,"Ford has CEOs in years &amp; nobody blinks, but Tesla loses intern &amp; its front page news. I tell ya (shakes fist at sky)"

5359,"Every car company is constantly changing prices, but nobody cares"
5360,"Import tariffs, VAT &amp; transport costs"
5361,"To be clear, this doesnt affect Tesla website order prices. Existing inventory prices are currently slightly lower than on website. This will bring them in line."
5362,"To be precise, midnight on April , so effective April"
5363,Please note prices on all Tesla inventory cars worldwide rise by ~3% on April
5364,About to be upgraded to Chromium
5365,Reset
5366,Sentry Mode options will be: Always Exclude Home Exclude Work Exclude saved locations Ask Off
5367,"If someone has already won a Roadster from a prior program, theyre only eligible to win the signed Performance Y"
5368,Sounds like a good idea
5369,How to win the boss fight in Sekiro
5370,"No, its cumulative, but once you win one of the prizes, referral count resets to zero &amp; you cant win that prize again. Intent over time is to enable those without a massive social media presence to win."
5371,WW
5372,"Agreed, you can only win each prize once"
5373,Youre welcome!

5382,Probably start Australia builds in late May or June &amp; start arriving in winter
5383,Coming soon
5384,"Yes, full duration"
5385,White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around Kelvin
5386,"Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach or , moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint."
5387,Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.
5388,No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
5389,Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles
5390,"Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots"
5391,Only some of the hottest sections
5392,Full size
5393,We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Dont need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
5394,"You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber."
5395,"Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations."
5396,Agreed
5397,"Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. Were simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to % would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed."
5398,"Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout"
5399,"Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely."
5400,First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
5401,Goes against interests of all Texans
5402,"Wow, this is crazy"
5403,"If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day , thats fine"
5404,"To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after youve had your Tesla for a week"
5405,Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at .
5406,Yes!
5407,"Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades arent so crazy"
5408,"This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes dont actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules."
5409,"Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production"
5410,"Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer"
5411,"Model partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but thats a lot of complexity."
5412,"Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isnt critical for snowy regions."
5413,"Still get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice."
5414,"About a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of Tesla cyberpunk truck"

5433,Looking forward to building a Boring Company tunnel in Vegas. Assuming to be operational by end of year!
5434,Yes
5435,Our list prices are our actual prices. Software (and automotive) vary prices frequently by changing the discount or rebate.
5436,"Sure, that would be great"
5437,Sure
5438,Correct
5439,Thats the plan
5440,Of course
5441,"In retrospect, lower price shouldnt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldnt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday."
5442,"However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak"
5443,"We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board."
5444,"When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought dont want to write Tesla a check. So it goes."
5445,Yes
5446,Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too
5447,Applies worldwide
5448,Yes
5449,"Tesla car prices go up ~3% next week, except for $35k Model . Order online at before then for current prices."
5450,Couldnt resolve all the rights issues. Will add another racing game soon.
5451,Ok
5452,"Yeah, it might break"
5453,Software release later this week should make it better
5454,True (sigh)
5455,True
5456,"Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although theyre critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term."
5457,"For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesnt have same safety criticality as crew."
5458,Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface
5459,"Most likely, but this is contingent upon NASA review &amp; approval"
5460,"Best to use a giant brake pad, aka heat shield"
5461,No
5462,"Dragon was designed to land using thrusters, with parachutes as backup. Switched to chutes as primary, due to difficulty of proving safety, but Dragon can still do it."

5467,Thank you on behalf of the people of SpaceX!
5468,"All good, system maintained room temperature within spacecraft"
5469,"Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator, version"
5470,Atmospheric entry at mph is like a meteor &amp; will vaporize steel. Burn marks below are on cold side. Main heatshield on bottom.
5471,"Yes, invitations go out tomorrow"
5472,Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time
5473,"We will spend or months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide."
5474,"Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from kW to +kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of best case &amp; more than for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput."
5475,"Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to % for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original Model S. Not splitting power across Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to %."
5476,So true
5477,Extremely important merch
5478,"Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm)"
5479,"Yes, but an engine shouldnt count until it flies"
5480,Ukraine did play a major role
5481,Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You wont notice it in range.
5482,"If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power"
5483,Russia has excellent rocket engineering &amp; best engine currently flying. Reusable version of their new Angara rocket would be great.
5484,"Thanks, that sounds great!"
5485,Youre most welcome. Very proud of Tesla team. Super tough years!
5486,"Oh stop, youll make me blush"
5487,Ok
5488,"Yeah, I lift a little"
5489,Tesla comms is fixing. That was a mistake.
5490,So cute!
5491,Buddy is like an Earth Pokmon
5492,"Gap in understanding is that $35k Model production *starts* this month, but will not reach volume production until mid year. Extremely difficult to predict middle part of manufacturing S-curve."
5493,Yes
5494,"No, just literally having toast &amp; jam while playing Jamming"
5495,Having toast &amp; jam in kitchen while playing Jamming by Bob Marley
5496,"Yes. Personally, Im most excited by the Tesla Truck. Maybe it will be too futuristic for most people, but I love it."
5497,"Yes, anyone will be able to take videos"
5498,I believe so
5499,"No, that unveil is later this year"
5500,Slightly higher drag * slightly higher frontal area affects air friction &amp; mass affects rolling resistance &amp; hill climb. Physics is the law.
5501,Normal
5502,Yes
5503,"Detailed specs &amp; pricing will be provided, as well as test rides in Y"
5504,"Model Y, being an SUV, is about % bigger than Model , so will cost about % more &amp; have slightly less range for same battery"
5505,Model Y unveil event on March at LA Design Studio

5515,I am not a dog. Heres a pic of me:
5516,Model S will be raised to mph too
5517,Thank you. May you have good luck and godspeed with your spacecraft!
5518,"Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also, thank you to , without whom this would not be possible."
5519,Power will increase on all cars. Top speed on P increases to mph. Range on RWD increases to miles.
5520,"Yes, new cars and existing fleet"
5521,Firmware update coming later this month will increase power by ~5% &amp; top speed by km/h or mph
5522,Spoiler alert: not Porsche
5523,Thank you on behalf of the many people of SpaceX
5524,Lightning bolt right before launch
5525,Earth floats gently in zero gravity
5526,SpaceX Crew Dragon recap
5527,Need to get back to SpaceX launch control. Sorry this solution isnt perfect.
5528,"Were trying to make EVs &amp; autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company."
5529,Will take a few days for system update
5530,"Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back."
5531,"Its not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term"
5532,"If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k"
5533,"If you bought a Tesla before yesterdays price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less)"
5534,He is the sensor!
5535,"Nope, hes going to float around in zero gravity"
5536,Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!
5537,Happy birthday!
5538,"Yeah, just use a dryer outlet. High power, easy to install &amp; low cost."
5539,Explanation from Tesla later today
5540,Yes
5541,Haha
5542,Ripley
5543,"Base Model available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia to months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes &amp; import duties mean price may be % or more above US number."
5544,Exactly
5545,No reductions from here
5546,For sure. It fundamentally improves quality of life.
5547,Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot
5548,Exact Tesla Model in my profile pic costs $35k before incentives &amp; takes minute to buy online at
5549,I think we should do something here. Will talk with team &amp; send out a note in next few days.
5550,Should be ~5% peak power increase with March software release
5551,"Scheduled for March release, along with many other improvements"
5552,"Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways, advanced summon &amp; autopark"
5553,I was being too obvious
5554,Make the Mars Technocracy real
5555,Yay!
5556,ET phone home. No answer
5557,Some Tesla news
5558,Haha

5562,California
5563,Thursday pm
5564,"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. Its X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, X harder."
5565,"Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
5566,"Yes, exciting potential"
5567,Exactly
5568,"Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Cant print yet."
5569,Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
5570,"Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through that were critical to SpaceXs success. Great respect &amp; appreciation!"
5571,"Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
5572,"Indeed. I have great respect for judges. Its not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."
5573,"SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states k to k. How embarrassing"
5574,Oh hi lol
5575,"Fate *loves* irony. Frankly, too much."
5576,Meetings are a valuable use of time!
5577,Theres a in my
5578,Respawn++
5579,Great meme review hosted by Will Smith
5580,Haha true
5581,Its designed to be way better. Well see what reality has to say about that.
5582,"Yes, lot of risk"
5583,"Guys, I have feelings"
5584,Focusing on Starship instead
5585,Deorbits &amp; burns up over the Pacific
5586,"Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; Dragon abort thrusters."
5587,"Including Heavy, which is cores, around or so"
5588,"Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. Thats scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
5589,"High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least or missions for Falcon . Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
5590,Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
5591,Yes
5592,Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April.
5593,Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
5594,"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
5595,SN2 has changes that should help
5596,To the first part. I doubt wed create a Dyson ring or sphere.
5597,Yes
5598,"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN , which is almost done."
5599,"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
5600,"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
5601,You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
5602,Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
5603,"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
5604,"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
5605,"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing High engine chamber pressure and ablative dont get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
5606,"Thats true Merlin A was terrible. C was ok, D good, but block Merlin (should probably be called E) is something special. Took about years to get there."
5607,"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for launch capability. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
5608,Dont know
5609,"SpaceX commercial launch market share went from % in to % in . Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years."
5610,"Exactly. Thats the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
5611,"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but Im worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
5612,So true John Clarke
5613,"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner"
5614,Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
5615,"That said, I still only own BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Dont have any crypto holdings."
5616,"I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day . Had I been better, our first launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes."
5617,"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of probably around k, ie k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about k."
5618,Wont be long before they do
5619,"Tesla made cars in , but will make around k in"
5620,Tesla cars loading in SF for Europe
5621,The gritty truth
5622,Did meme review last night with Justin Roiland from
5623,Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
5624,Pics are so clear in space!
5625,That last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like
5626,"Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI &amp; I didnt agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up &amp; it was just better to part ways on good terms."
5627,I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering &amp; manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) &amp; SpaceX
5628,"To clarify, Ive not been involved closely with OpenAI for over a year &amp; dont have mgmt or board oversight"
5629,SpaceX foundry casting Raptor engine manifold out of Inconel
5630,It will soon
5631,"Yes, Autopilot max speed is mph above speed limit off highway or mph on highway"
5632,Of course I still love you
5633,"This is in addition to existing Cabin Overheat Protection, which come on automatically at high temps to ensure any babies or pets in the car are safe"
5634,Yes
5635,"It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then, if that looks good, speed up next week. We def need to add a Request Latest Update feature!"
5636,Updating
5637,"Wow,"
5638,CNBC - Tesla Model ranked most satisfying car
5639,"True, that headline is not exactly going to win a Pulitzer for originality"
5640,"Probably a month or two. Sentry mode became top priority, so pushed that out a bit."
5641,"Some sites maintained an almost daily Tesla deathwatch years ago, reporting with an awful delight. days later"
5642,Tesla Model X first SUV to receive a perfect crash test rating via
5643,Bet the other carmakers didnt see that one coming haha
5644,"Yeah, but simpler. Needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a bubble."
5645,"Starship &amp; Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version . Very important, as helium costs more than oxygen on Falcon, even though liquid oxygen is /3 vehicle mass &amp; helium weighs basically nothing."
5646,"Luke, I am your farter."
5647,"Thanks Jack, Twitter rocks!"
5648,To air is human
5649,Agreed
5650,Sorry Had a vital mission in Norway Now I am back
5651,True
5652,"Moon first, Mars as soon as the planets align"
5653,On my bedside table
5654,A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
5655,"Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress &amp; setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!"
5656,The goodwill of the public is critical to Starships success
5657,At least X cheaper
5658,"Very dependent on volume, but Im confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want."
5659,Yes
5660,"This will sound implausible, but I think theres a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon"
5661,Close
5662,"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
5663,Much above bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of to + bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
5664,"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
5665,"Yes, aiming for sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe if we get lucky."
5666,I think where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
5667,About secs
5668,Definitely! Its amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
5669,"Raptor reached bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by engine/test team!"
5670,I was simply too sexy for it
5671,Maybe tomorrow
5672,"Just left Zeebrugge, now Tilburg, then Tesla HQ in Amsterdam &amp; Oslo tonight to review service in Norway. Exciting to see thousands of Model s on their way to owners in Europe!"
5673,Hope they dont find this pic!
5674,thank goodness its not November
5675,a
5676,I want you too baby
5677,Joe Rogan describes Tesla for mins &amp; secs
5678,"Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
5679,"Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
5680,"Rocket booster temperatures wont go much above Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around K for a Mach entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
5681,Prob wise for version to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
5682,"Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
5683,"The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just Starship &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"
5684,SpaceX Engineering
5685,Telekinesis
5686,Vaporized some copper
5687,Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
5688,"Design requires at least metric tons of force. Engine reached mT &amp; bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means % to % more with deep cryo."
5689,Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship &amp; Super Heavy
5690,"Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow."
5691,Were doing everything we can to get there. Its a super hard grind.
5692,"Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other &amp; lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, its way better."
5693,VAT of ~20% &amp; import duties of ~10% usually result in a % higher cost in Europe
5694,Mach Diamonds
5695,Glad you like it
5696,Spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite preburners &amp; main chamber
5697,"Gaseous CH4/O2 &amp; heavy duty spark plugs. Basically, a of insane power"
5698,"Will do, although SpaceX reddit is very well-informed. Really impressive analysis by some commenters."
5699,Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.
5700,First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine! So proud of great work by team!!
5701,We will when it rolls out
5702,Yes
5703,At Texas with engineering team getting ready to fire new Raptor rocket engine
5704,soon
5705,Only a matter of time
5706,That might be the ultimate superpower
5707,How Model performs on a long road trip
5708,"Im openly moderate. There, I said it."
5709,Haha how is this even real?
5710,"No, payload will actually increase"
5711,Exactly
5712,I do like nonsense memes. Its true.
5713,Yes
5714,Next few days
5715,looks like sentient choc ice cream
5716,Just bought oh yeah
5717,Whoa cool
5718,No plans to do so. Would recommend Model S.
5719,logarithms
5720,Dammit!
5721,"Well tweak the alloy over time, so it wont exactly be , but close"
5722,"Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart"
5723,"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesnt even need paint!"
5724,Still up to . Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
5725,Mostly true
5726,"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so wont need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
5727,Yes
5728,Initially making one metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
5729,Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at Texas
5730,Yes. Its very rare to find all three.
5731,"To be clear, Im confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding"
5732,"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
5733,"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack"
5734,Absolutely. Youve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
5735,And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar
5736,"About orbit synch windows, which are every months, so self-sufficiency around"
5737,All our patent are belong to you
5738,"Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the worlds factories every day"
5739,Exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market! We created Tesla to accelerate a sustainable future &amp; its happening!
5740,Tasty food!
5741,Its designed for people on a Mars journey
5742,Super appreciate Deepaks year history building Tesla &amp; wish him greatest of happiness in retirement! Zach has been outstanding over his year history with Tesla &amp; will build upon Deepaks legacy.
5743,"Sure, which ones?"
5744,Youre most welcome! Very thoughtful questions.
5745,Max Tegmark is great
5746,Entropy is the source and the end of life in this instance of the Multiverse
5747,guys standing on roof of skyscraper. st guy says updraft is so strong it blows you back on roof of you jump off. He jumps off &amp; is blown back on roof. nd guy tries &amp; goes splat. rd guy: that was a dirty trick Superman.
5748,"If heat death will be inevitable end of Universe, it actually *is* all about journey"
5749,Entropy is the ultimate boss battle
5750,Haha
5751,tbh smh
5752,Haha true
5753,SpaceX documentary actual footage
5754,"All we had back then was carpet &amp; a mariachi band. Now, SPACESHIP!!"
5755,Sure hope that happens
5756,"Great electric car documentary about early days of Tesla, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf &amp; Gadget. So much has happened since then"
5757,We are so tiny
5758,"You drive a hard bargain, but ok"
5759,Host meme review?
5760,"Its an honor, sir! Thanks for owning a Tesla."
5761,Tap Tesla logo at top of your cars touchscreen &amp; wait secs to open special features box
5762,Still my favorite tweet of all time
5763,"Ok, well throw that in too"
5764,"But, occasionally, the metal version"
5765,Haha
5766,Tesla Sentry Mode will play Bachs Toccata and Fugue during a robbery (and keep Summer safe)
5767,"All doors unlock automatically when the Tesla comes to a stop after an accident. There is both primary &amp; backup power to doors, brakes, steering &amp; airbags."
5768,Cool that this is happening on many fronts. Looks like a good design by .
5769,"Yeah, worked on my cousins farm for six weeks around my th birthday. I was so kewl."
5770,Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software
5771,So tempting
5772,Its like looking in a mirror!
5773,That would be so cool!
5774,"Yes, and my grandfather was from Minnesota with some Scandinavian/German background. Got to hand it to Norway. Thats a great sculpture!"
5775,Awesome moose sculpture!
5776,Rough beta in to weeks
5777,Feature has now been in place for months
5778,These are industrial strength. Not recommended for use at home!
5779,Testing metallic heat shield at C (2000F)
5780,"Sure. Also, we need to be better at remembering brightness settings."
5781,The youth love em
5782,"If test flight of goes well next month, will to this summer!"
5783,Actual tanks are fine
5784,"~1750K is peak heating expected on about % of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on %. Rest drops below K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of % of the ship. Another reason for steel."
5785,I just heard. mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
5786,"S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate degrees of delta temp"
5787,Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
5788,"Since its part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it"
5789,Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
5790,"Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels."
5791,Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
5792,"When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water"
5793,untrue
5794,Roughly to minutes for light to travel from Earth to Mars
5795,Director of CERN asked me about Boring Co building the new LHC tunnel when we were at the . Would probably save several billon Euros.
5796,Yes
5797,Blood moon over LA tonight ()
5798,The zooms around the world about every mins
5799,Tesla is the safest car according to US govt testing
5800,"I wish them well. Track record in auto startups is tough. Thousands of US auto startups, but only Ford &amp; Tesla have avoided bankruptcy. A similar scenario is likely in all countries."
5801,Wow
5802,Yup
5803,"Thanks, good idea!"
5804,"Yes, ending on Feb . Its adding too much cost to the cars, especially Model ."
5805,Order must occur before Feb
5806,"No, the whole referral incentive system will end"
5807,"The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb . If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla &amp; give them months of free Supercharging, please do so before then."
5808,I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
5809,"Dragon was originally designed to land with thrusters, but its not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings"
5810,How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
5811,"Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX"
5812,"The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication"
5813,"The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport."
5814,Haha youre welcome! Hope youre doing well.
5815,"About $15M/km for a two way high speed transit, so probably around $750M plus maybe $50M/station"
5816,Glad you like it
5817,Yes
5818,LA is so beautiful after the rain
5819,SpaceX Dragon from as seen from viewport
5820,Falcon comes home
5821,We are not yet offering the mid range Model in Europe
5822,"Which country? There is a % import duty, ~20% VAT (US prices dont include sales tax) and about $2000 in extra shipping cost, but it shouldnt add up to $25k."
5823,View of SpaceX Dragon berthed with in the last Cupola opening. Dragon (Crew Dragon) launching soon.
5824,Ok
5825,Obv must be more pointy tho
5826,It needed to be made real
5827,Haha
5828,Starship Hopper will do vertical flight tests similar to the Falcon Hopper
5829,Body/tank diameter is m or about ft
5830,Should be done with first orbital prototype around June
5831,Yes
5832,Yes
5833,Yes
5834,"This is for suborbital VTOL tests. Orbital version is taller, has thicker skins (wont wrinkle) &amp; a smoothly curving nose section."
5835,"Starship test flight rocket just finished assembly at the Texas launch site. This is an actual picture, not a rendering."
5836,Yes
5837,Getting some regulatory pushback. May not be available in all regions.
5838,Going through final validation &amp; regulatory approval. Probably releases to early access program owners in a few weeks. Its trippy!
5839,Yes
5840,Tesla *with* Autopilot engaged is twice as safe &amp; continues to make steady improvements
5841,Def not
5842,Yes
5843,"Starting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the kWh version of the Model S &amp; X. If youd like that version, please order by Sunday night at"
5844,Good idea
5845,Its an option
5846,Vertically or horizontally?
5847,No problem
5848,"Plus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance"
5849,I dont think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.
5850,Im not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the rear seats.
5851,It will be
5852,"Btw, you can buy a Tesla online in less than mins &amp; give it back for a full refund for any reason"
5853,The new Roadster will actually do something like this
5854,And now we dance!
5855,Great thread
5856,"Shanghai Giga will produce affordable versions of /Y for greater China. All Model S/X &amp; higher cost versions of Model /Y will still be built in US for WW market, incl China."
5857,"Shanghai Giga output is just for greater China, not North America. Affordable cars must be made on same continent as customers."
5858,Shanghai Giga production of Model /Y will serve greater China region
5859,"Aiming to finish initial construction this summer, start Model production end of year &amp; reach high volume production next year"
5860,Looking forward to breaking ground on the Shanghai Gigafactory today!
5861,Good sign that almost no Model owners want to sell their cars!
5862,"Yes, will be extremely intense. Early flights are especially dangerous, as theres a lot of new hardware."
5863,"Sorry, to be clear, this pic is all real. Nothing rendered."
5864,Falcon on launch pad with Crew Dragon &amp; new astronaut walkway
5865,"Spiral-winding is great for uniform thickness. We used that for the Hyperloop vacuum tunnel. However, Starship skin thickness will vary considerably according to loads."
5866,Exactly
5867,Its all in the way you say it
5868,Matt DeBord reviews all Tesla models via
5869,I do love Tintin
5870,More on this in a few months
5871,"Starship test vehicle under assembly will look similar to this illustration when finished. Operational Starships would obv have windows, etc."
5872,"Aiming for weeks, which probably means weeks, due to unforeseen issues"
5873,"Good shot of Starship flight test vehicle being assembled in Boca Chica, Texas"
5874,Engines currently on Starship hopper are a blend of Raptor development &amp; operational parts. First hopper engine to be fired is almost finished assembly in California. Probably fires next month.
5875,Haha
5876,Not yet
5877,Thats a reasonable question
5878,About a month away from the first orbital test flight of crew Dragon
5879,Probably
5880,Thats what I heard

5910,Thanks Tesla owners in China! Looking forward to visiting soon for the groundbreaking of Gigafactory Shanghai!
5911,"Turns out if you take Dayquil, you exit The Matrix"
5912,Excited to have Larry Ellison &amp; Kathleen Wilson-Thompson join the Tesla board!
5913,Ok
5914,Tesla team did a great job!
5915,Yes
5916,I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April
5917,Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
5918,Exactly
5919,Yes
5920,Probability at % &amp; rising rapidly due to new architecture
5921,Congratulations
5922,Coming soon
5923,Yes
5924,Got it
5925,"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico."
5926,Yep
5927,Yes
5928,"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to % of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
5929,"Most people dont know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
5930,We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
5931,Ok
5932,Wow!
5933,"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
5934,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:"
5935,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because its electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
5936,"There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"
5937,Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in days! Order online at to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
5938,Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!!
5939,"No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ..."

5941,Sigh
5942,Yes
5943,"Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side"
5944,Glad youre ok!
5945,Starship will look like liquid silver
5946,Haha
5947,Maybe
5948,Much less
5949,Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.
5950,"Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better"
5951,"Yes, signal acquired from that dish"
5952,Stainless Steel Starship
5953,Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
5954,When its no longer noticeable over Plancks length
5955,Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earths gravitational reach is infinite. Zero gravity is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
5956,At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
5957,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
5958,Engineering is true magic
5959,Yezzz
5960,How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
5961,Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities
5962,Please put invented car fart on my gravestone. This is my only request.
5963,Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
5964,"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."
5965,Thanks!
5966,"Its embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
5967,You def dont want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need horsepower per engine. Thats not a typo.
5968,"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to bar. That is a mad level."
5969,Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
5970,"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
5971,"Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word star or link"
5972,"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars."
5973,Coldformed at cryo
5974,"This test hopper is at full body diameter of m / ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter."
5975,Were building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
5976,Exactly
5977,"For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry."
5978,Yes
5979,"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle were building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
5980,"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; were using a different alloy mix. I super Series Stainless!"
5981,"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
5982,"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
5983,"If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
5984,Coming soon
5985,"It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model orders delivered by year end"
5986,Try connecting to WiFi
5987,"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer cant take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in days. Order online at or visit stores."
5988,Only if Dawkins joins
5989,Interesting
5990,Bajirao Mastani
5991,"Anxiety is a scalar, fear is a vector"
5992,Yes
5993,Haha
5994,Namaste
5995,Needs a warmup
5996,Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every minutes! Hope you have a Merry Christmas!
5997,"Thanks, will consider next year"
5998,"So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this wont matter for the first few layers"
5999,Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in mins with a few taps. No more need to call!
6000,"As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a after them haha"
6001,"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that built a ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally X better, should be operational next year. For reference:"
6002,Join our underground movement!
6003,"Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out"
6004,Ok
6005,Autopilot doesnt need the guide wheels. Theyre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
6006,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
6007,Exactly
6008,"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
6009,"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
6010,"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
6011,"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think theyre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
6012,"Youre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didnt include it. Were working on one that makes things clear."
6013,"Pop up, park and walk!"
6014,I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding rd St.
6015,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"
6016,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety."
6017,Next step for Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is vehicles/hour at mph (250km/h).
6018,Precisely
6019,Presentation starting at :15
6020,"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
6021,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start"
6022,"Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but its time to upgrade to something better."
6023,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
6024,"Capable of traveling safely at over mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
6025,Yes
6026,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
6027,Tesla in tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
6028,Boring product launch will be streamed live at pm California time tonight
6029,Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
6030,Same applies to those who didnt order PUP
6031,Exactly. Its a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
6032,"Yeah, I wrote that back in , almost years ago!"
6033,"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers &amp; cell phones. It takes many design iterations &amp; vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability."
6034,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
6035,Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiels Founders Fund: we have no concerns whatsoever.
6036,"Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
6037,Tis
6038,Medieval Futurism
6039,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
6040,Thanks!
6041,The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats &amp; just wipe it off.
6042,Congratulations!
6043,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in weeks, even if you havent placed an order yet"
6044,You got it
6045,Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build &amp; interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
6046,Zero Suit
6047,God Fire
6048,ramen is sooo good
6049,Exactly
6050,This part is true. I was trying to explain that we dont want our cars to have a tinny sound.
6051,You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
6052,Seems likely that well be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though
6053,"Incorrect. Chairman is an honorific, not executive role, which means its not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in years. Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut provided I have the support of shareholders."
6054,About to days
6055,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get days to return for full refund vs day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
6056,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla cant deliver your car this year."
6057,No need to wait. Its super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
6058,Im dying to make a pickup truck so bad we might have a prototype to unveil next year
6059,Yes
6060,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they dont believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they dont need to be."
6061,Probably next month
6062,Youre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story.
6063,"Were opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
6064,Probably end of next year
6065,So true
6066,This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
6067,"Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
6068,We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
6069,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over X the image processing ability."
6070,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
6071,"If you have a Tesla built in past years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps."
6072,Machete!!
6073,"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had % of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
6074,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car -2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldnt exist or would have started much later."
6075,"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China."
6076,"Buying took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didnt like even when we were only making ."
6077,"Tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late . Hed originally filed for it in . Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
6078,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
6079,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
6080,Yes
6081,Interesting
6082,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
6083,The new design is metal
6084,"As far as we know, its the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesnt need heat shielding or even paint."
6085,Boring Company product launch on Dec . More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
6086,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
6087,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
6088,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
6089,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
6090,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
6091,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
6092,Falcon/Dragon launch to in minutes
6093,Us too sigh
6094,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
6095,satellites on this flight!
6096,"Were adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
6097,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if theres no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
6098,It is so hard to move in armor!
6099,Youre all hired!
6100,Yes no maybe
6101,None shall pass!
6102,Ok
6103,Good advice
6104,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. Were also working on vision-only driving.
6105,Glad youre ok
6106,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
6107,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly % range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
6108,"Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
6109,You got it!
6110,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
6111,No
6112,No
6113,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Cant wipe it off."
6114,Haha
6115,"Prof Dahn is correct (hes great), but the relative benefit is small. Id recommend % more SoC for convenience."
6116,"Not worth going below % imo. Even % is still fine. Also, no issue going to % or lower SoC."
6117,True
6118,Both
6119,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
6120,One day
6121,"Were doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but were just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
6122,Update soon
6123,Sorry
6124,Boring breakthrough
6125,Definitely
6126,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
6127,We tried. Nintendo wont license it to us.
6128,That would be cool
6129,Haha kinda true
6130,Never heard of it
6131,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games."
6132,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
6133,Yes
6134,"This is completely backwards. Based on what weve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, were moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Wont need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
6135,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
6136,Tiny wizard
6137,to years
6138,"Engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
6139,Touch
6140,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesnt feel like work"
6141,"Varies per person, but about sustained, peaking above at times. Pain level increases exponentially above ."
6142,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on hours a week"
6143,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then , , &amp; are the places to be."
6144,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
6145,liters of pure water costs $1
6146,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
6147,Ah yes fair point
6148,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
6149,Not yet
6150,trouble
6151,Earth is
6152,"Earths crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava"
6153,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is % water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as its all land. Even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about /3 land."
6154,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
6155,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks &amp; heatshield"
6156,"If you dont want a Tesla, heres a list of all electric cars in North America via"
6157,Signing off for a while
6158,Happy Thanksgiving!!
6159,Starships were meant to fly
6160,Starship Tooters
6161,Good one
6162,Good idea
6163,Coming soon
6164,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
6165,Should be next week
6166,"No, its the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon"
6167,Later versions will
6168,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earths deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
6169,Renaming BFR to Starship
6170,"No, were just going to accelerate BFR"
6171,Yes
6172,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
6173,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of % to % of population in all active markets.
6174,"No, its got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about % to % of effort, all things considered."
6175,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
6176,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
6177,"Lot on our plate, so its either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
6178,Ok
6179,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. Thats a great van. We will inquire.
6180,Absolutely agree
6181,Investigating
6182,Probably mid
6183,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
6184,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
6185,Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
6186,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
6187,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
6188,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
6189,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
6190,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isnt needed
6191,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with or taps
6192,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive."
6193,Radical change
6194,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
6195,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
6196,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to in Model for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
6197,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
6198,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
6199,Missed miku concert sigh
6200,Listening to Better Now
6201,"China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation &amp; transport"
6202,"Sure hope this isnt true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
6203,Haha
6204,Looking back at the sun from upper stage &amp; Falcon landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
6205,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for min bulk discount.
6206,While (!castle) {brick++};
6207,Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
6208,Fortnite irl
6209,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
6210,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
6211,Not much but it is ours
6212,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
6213,"We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains dont leave often."
6214,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
6215,Yes
6216,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
6217,We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
6218,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
6219,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, its better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
6220,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model can be delivered in US by Dec if ordered by Nov
6221,We will fight Big Tequila!
6222,That would be awesome
6223,Easily accessible energy
6224,Send me a note!
6225,Would be fun to add to Tesla
6226,Yes
6227,Will try again next month
6228,"Congratulations team! Thanks , much appreciated."
6229,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever."
6230,Is he ok?
6231,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
6232,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
6233,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
6234,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for grant money. They earn vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
6235,"That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
6236,"We know well run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far"
6237,Because people on the ground know more about whats actually needed than politicians do
6238,"Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model ."
6239,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
6240,"Fair point, will reenable"
6241,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
6242,Please lmk what youd most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
6243,Cool
6244,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
6245,Yes
6246,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
6247,"No, were building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
6248,Wont land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we cant test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
6249,Aiming for orbital flight by June
6250,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship
6251,But comments are
6252,LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec . Runs parallel to freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to .
6253,"I think Twitter is deleting fake, scam or maybe even inactive accounts. My follower count decreased by ~20k over the past few days."
6254,"Sure, we can do it"
6255,Zeroth Law
6256,Foundation of psychohistory
6257,I am not
6258,True
6259,B or !2B
6260,Love Oumuamua jokes
6261,Remember the future
6262,Oh hi guys lol
6263,"Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent"
6264,"Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating &amp; decelerating"
6265,So underappreciated
6266,Ok
6267,Ok
6268,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec . Will be very one-dimensional.
6269,"Sounds like pure luxury! When I said sponge, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with trillion siblings."
6270,What is love?
6271,Bikini Bottom
6272,Fair
6273,"Yes, that is how"
6274,We didnt even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
6275,Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
6276,Wow thats cool!
6277,Kids these days have it easy
6278,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
6279,Haha
6280,First movie I ever saw in theaters
6281,When the only existing life was a sponge
6282,Although it was in the precambrian era
6283,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.
6284,Theyre great! Honored to work with them.
6285,Yes
6286,Definitely
6287,"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
6288,"Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in"
6289,"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
6290,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
6291,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
6292,"Amazing results by at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
6293,Prob to weeks
6294,v true
6295,cute
6296,Haha
6297,Bring Me the Horizon
6298,Aiming for next week
6299,Norway
6300,"r wrong, but in Tesla makes s overseas &amp; East Coast in st half of quarter"
6301,"Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway"
6302,We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
6303,Hahaha &lt;ahem&gt;
6304,Um yes
6305,"Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon &amp; say whos the pet now"
6306,"Also, youll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"
6307,Car will drive to your phone location &amp; follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
6308,"Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
6309,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
6310,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm its valid &amp; park."
6311,Cool haha
6312,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer &amp; secretary. Guess I have to keep st one or it will confuse the authorities."
6313,"Good point, might put that one back"
6314,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. Im now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
6315,Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
6316,"Dont worry, well make it right"
6317,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Cant wait.
6318,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
6319,"Its a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action"
6320,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of production hell sounds like a sure thing!?"
6321,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
6322,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
6323,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
6324,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
6325,Didnt you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers dont get that.
6326,Exactly. Thats Monday.
6327,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
6328,"No, but I will"
6329,Isnt it obvious?
6330,Worth it
6331,True
6332,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
6333,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
6334,Haha
6335,"On Insta, % of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get %."
6336,Lacks scale
6337,"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
6338,"Reddits twitter account is lame, because its not real Reddit"
6339,Exactly
6340,Youre right. Earlier Model Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
6341,"On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. Its great."
6342,Glad youre ok
6343,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model , so bikes can fit in trunk"
6344,Hey thats my Halloween costume!
6345,Good question
6346,"Clearly, youre not reading my twitter"
6347,I wish
6348,Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases.
6349,Yes Zorbix
6350,"Sir, I would never"
6351,"Yes, I am a little girl. Ok, not that little. Or a girl."
6352,Making progress
6353,I said dankest not darkest omg

6365,Midnight
6366,My twitter feed rn
6367,Then the hell with science!
6368,Not moths tho
6369,Send me ur dankest memes!!
6370,in
6371,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
6372,Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
6373,"Model was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model was product alone."
6374,Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldnt be here without you.
6375,Same
6376,Howd they know!?
6377,Around mid
6378,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
6379,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
6380,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldnt look like a radiator grill opening.
6381,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that theres no such thing as a Tesla refresh. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
6382,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov . Order now to be sure of the one you want."
6383,"Model body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
6384,Working on it
6385,That is correct
6386,Twitter thought I got hacked &amp; locked my account haha
6387,Wanna buy some Bitcoin?
6388,And I own a chibi Wolverine
6389,ianime
6390,"Order Tesla without test drive &amp; you get days to return for refund, else day"
6391,Former
6392,Will be in next point release
6393,"Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country."
6394,Good point
6395,Interesting
6396,"This is a ~ ft demo tunnel. First operational, high-speed tunnel still set for Chicago, pending regulatory approvals."
6397,Under LA (Hawthorne)
6398,mph | km/h
6399,Opening event that night &amp; free rides for the public next day
6400,"Pretty close, actually"
6401,I think real
6402,Opens Dec
6403,The first tunnel is almost done
6404,N00B!
6405,Twitter is Dark Souls of social media. Reddit is Bloodborne. Insta is Zelda.
6406,Good idea!
6407,"This game is my personal favorite, but I am biased towards space stuff"
6408,Coming soon
6409,Turn on enhanced security via the settings page. This will require entering a passcode to use the car.
6410,Digital Style!
6411,Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time?
6412,BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. Its time people knew.
6413,"No, bored me, I will not"
6414,Maybe phone as controller
6415,Exactly
6416,Coming
6417,Yes
6418,Reality is hard
6419,Online doesnt count
6420,Coming soon
6421,No
6422,Thats next
6423,Had to been done ur welcome
6424,I hope this is true!
6425,"If you dont like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
6426,Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
6427,"Model long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
6428,"Its kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
6429,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just dont use sport/summer tires."
6430,"Its a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
6431,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model &amp; super simple new order page"
6432,Week or two
6433,Love the Reddit comments too
6434,Dog saves her puppies
6435,y
6436,Youll see
6437,Tomorrow brings a lemur
6438,Special Circumstances
6439,Yes
6440,New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
6441,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
6442,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
6443,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
6444,Just reviewed Teslas service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within to months.
6445,Insightful article by David
6446,"Thanks John, really admire you too! I think youre one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
6447,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
6448,I believe its $5k
6449,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
6450,Somewhere between % &amp; %
6451,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
6452,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
6453,Still a long way to go
6454,Model motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
6455,Works best if you play games full screen &amp; use steering wheel scroller balls for control
6456,Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now
6457,What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start.
6458,Yes
6459,Thanks for recognizing the great work of the Tesla team! people now.

6465,Maybe this could be part of a (safe) car version of Pokmon Go style game
6466,Towelie
6467,Good idea!
6468,Whole beer keg fits in Model trunk!
6469,"Wow, mechanical logic gates"
6470,Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
6471,Maybe wise to bring it just in case
6472,About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth &amp; half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens &amp; we destroy ourselves
6473,You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Dont have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
6474,Yes
6475,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."
6476,Visual approximation
6477,Teslaquila coming soon
6478,Glad youre safe
6479,Beautiful picture
6480,"Yes, its hard to find. Not sure why."
6481,"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSAs *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
6482,This is incorrect
6483,At Falcon LZ-1 Vandenberg on Sunday night with the Base Commander. Support of much appreciated.
6484,Studebaker Museum in South Bend
6485,Punctuality is not my strong suit
6486,Wed be nothing without our fans
6487,Because is obviously louder than
6488,No such thing as a full refresh at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
6489,It sure does. Very reliable.
6490,You are right
6491,A reminder of why its important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power
6492,"Youre most welcome, glad I could be helpful! Thanks for letting me know about it."

6499,My fav character
6500,Sonic boom warning. This wont be subtle.
6501,Two one for millions of years from now and one for you
6502,Yes
6503,"Yes, but in that were creating a generalized autonomy solution. Must work in millions of strange situations."
6504,Blade Runner Esper Edition Vangelis
6505,"Actually, its of forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. External cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked."
6506,Fair point
6507,"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to % of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as theyre just passive managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
6508,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
6509,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
6510,Only if theyre extremely tiny
6511,We dont judge. Any pic you want!
6512,Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla &amp; get any image they want laser etched in glass &amp; sent to deep space for millions of years
6513,Rococo Basilisk is
6514,First Falcon land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!
6515,The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
6516,"The big funds can &amp; will, as theyre suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for passive index tracking."
6517,"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
6518,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, dont realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
6519,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
6520,I hope to be less wrong over time
6521,Youre most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
6522,What they do should be illegal
6523,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
6524,Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
6525,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model actually outsold Camry by a factor of two"
6526,This is amazing
6527,Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to more users a few days ago.
6528,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
6529,"If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
6530,"Hang in there. If you are truly long-term, it will be fine."
6531,True
6532,Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? Its what they do.
6533,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
6534,Great verdict
6535,Could be worse
6536,"Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar &amp; side repeater camera neural nets just right."
6537,Something especially weird going on with Yahoo news feed on iPhone stocks app. Almost always super negative. Maybe getting gamed.
6538,Naughty by Nature
6539,Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
6540,Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
6541,That was intense
6542,i
6543,!! Will take action.
6544,And remember
6545,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
6546,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
6547,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
6548,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay!
6549,What would be great is original Elite
6550,Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
6551,Tesla Owners
6552,"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
6553,"Apologies, were upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
6554,Tricky one
6555,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners whod like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
6556,Probably for a base to be built
6557,Mars Base Alpha
6558,"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
6559,"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have % on front, % on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
6560,Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at
6561,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
6562,A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
6563,"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
6564,"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
6565,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
6566,"Exactly, all star are *not* the same, as the videos show. star just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
6567,Haha true
6568,. will post final safety probability stats soon. Model has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
6569,"Wow, glad theyre ok!"
6570,Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
6571,Tesla Rangers!
6572,"engines, but with room to add more down the road. Kinda have to."
6573,"Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldnt spend computing power on sound"
6574,Yes
6575,True
6576,"To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed"
6577,Youre most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
6578,Will do. Love Reddit.
6579,Space Bar
6580,"Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions &amp; anyone will be able to go"
6581,"Yeah, Starlink should be active by then"
6582,Sorry! So many bots!!
6583,"Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR, so itll feel like youre there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light"
6584,Perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play. There will be no obligation to do so.
6585,Very close
6586,Always
6587,Yes
6588,Thats the first BFR airframe/tank barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material
6589,"Yeah thats exactly how I feel. However it happens, I just hope it does."
6590,Thanks for helping fund a rocket &amp; spaceship that could take humanity beyond Earth!
6591,Hanging out with before the moon mission announcement
6592,Yusaku will be bringing (brave) artists &amp; cultural figures with him on the journey around the moon!
6593,Probably V10 alpha build
6594,"Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1."
6595,Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
6596,Thank you for your trust in the team. Greatly appreciated.
6597,Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
6598,Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. Its not sustainable long-term.
6599,Very interesting
6600,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night"
6601,This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
6602,"Yes, I do"
6603,Top SpaceX priority is and will remain supporting crewed spaceflight and National Security missions
6604,"Btw, cant emphasize enough how would not be where it is today without . Thank you."
6605,With lasers
6606,My fav tweet ever
6607,"if you can help get rid of the annoying scam spammers, that would be much appreciated"
6608,Ok
6609,Maybe the scammers will just get tired of winning eventually
6610,"Good catch. They are there in the flight design, but we forgot to put them in this render."
6611,Forward moving wing
6612,"Sorry, weve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. Were making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly."
6613,Awesome
6614,"Design has been changed so the lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins, two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control)"
6615,"Sorry, its not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesnt incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
6616,Yes
6617,"Yeah, thats our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
6618,"Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting s of makes &amp; models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
6619,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
6620,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
6621,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"
6622,True
6623,"Tesla owners can grant free Supercharging for life to a friend who buys S/3/X. Ends tomorrow night. """
6624,Hi Dustin!
6625,"The Tesla board has done incredible work overseeing the largest value creation in the auto industry in + years, despite many setbacks. Tesla owes its very existence to this board!"
6626,"The muskrat is like a beaver with small ideas, but it has a certain quiet dignity"
6627,Wut?
6628,Haha
6629,Intentionally so
6630,Electric cars made with sunlight
6631,Yes
6632,Bricks will be free if used for affordable housing projects
6633,Yes
6634,First Boring Brick store opening in ~2 months. Only cents a brick! Rated for California seismic loads.
6635,About to finish first TBC HQ building made with Boring Bricks in the shape of a medieval watchtower
6636,. will transport your car all the way into your garage
6637,Thoughtful feedback
6638,"Due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America, Tesla customers may experience longer response times. Resolving this is our top priority."
6639,"My apologies, am working on this exact issue right now"
6640,Best show in the multiverse!
6641,"No, service will stock all colors"
6642,"Love that red. We tried every possible way to make red look D without floating a special red tint in primary gloss layer, but no way. We have to stop whole paint shop for red &amp; it looks like an episode of Dexter."
6643,"Moving of Tesla colors off menu on Wednesday to simplify manufacturing. Obsidian Black &amp; Metallic Silver will still be available as special request, but at higher price."
6644,Looks cool
6645,"Not easy coming up with a good cover story for an underground volcano lair, but I think its working"
6646,Test-driving our new boring machine with a

6648,Like sands through the hourglass
6649,types of people in the world: those who understand binary &amp; those who dont
6650,"Will do soon, as promised"
6651,"Not me, Im gonna die right here in the USA. Or Mars. Just not on impact."
6652,I am a business magnet
6653,Good times with
6654,Will add a fade mode with only essential info
6655,"Tesla st, nd &amp; rd in August sales"
6656,Will be on at :30pm Pacific on Thursday
6657,"Am running it in my car, but its not right yet. Hopefully, will release to advanced early access users in a week or two, then more broadly towards end of month."
6658,"Much appreciated! Great word-of-mouth is why Model is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements."
6659,"The multi-coat colors (pearl white &amp; red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth &amp; complexity"
6660,"Sorry, weve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint &amp; quality in general. If need be, were repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done."
6661,Can Steve Bannon please insult me some more? Best PR Ive had in a while.
6662,I was told that his parents preferred that his name not be mentioned
6663,V cool
6664,So you actually did nothing &amp; yet imply you are a truth-seeker. The Twitter name you chose is .
6665,"Answer the question . You brought it up, not me. Did you investigate or not? If so, what did you actually do?"
6666,"At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam"
6667,Did you investigate at all? Im guessing answer is no. Why?
6668,"Its coming, I swear"
6669,You dont think its strange he hasnt sued me? He was offered free legal services. And you call yourself
6670,Great actions by Twitter to delete bogus accounts. Will increase usage by real users.
6671,"For the record, my voice cracked once during the NY Times article. Thats it. There were no tears."
6672,Sure
6673,I want that outfit
6674,"The world lost a great man in John McCain. He was an honorable, kind, brave and fundamentally decent human being. If only there were more such people in the world."
6675,This is why a small company with tight focus &amp; high energy can beat a big company without
6676,This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be % renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
6677,"Most people dont realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks &amp; other service costs."
6678,"Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model production system. Wish it wasnt so hard to be less stupid over time"
6679,Maybe
6680,"This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldnt make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors."
6681,"The extension cord was miles long, but still"
6682,"Whats cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord"
6683,"In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public."
6684,Its almost done
6685,"Yes , looks brutal otherwise"
6686,This is actually real
6687,"This time, the vacuum tunnel will be a bit longer &amp; SpaceX will provide some advance funding for student teams with most promising designs. Bonus award for all race pods that exceed half the speed of sound!"
6688,"Tesla Car Karaoke hopefully ready in OTA software update version . Just played Missile Command, Asteroids &amp; Lunar Lander in V9. Really fun!"
6689,I was just there. Cardboard being prepped for recycling along southern fence line caught fire. Super appreciate fast response by Fremont fire dept! No injuries or damage to factory.
6690,"Goal is to service your car wherever you are, quietly &amp; quickly. No need to bring it to a Tesla service center."
6691,Ok
6692,"Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought. The Red and The Black"
6693,So many saved drafts. So so many.
6694,Im dying to
6695,"Cool, lmk if you have suggestions for improvement after you drive it"
6696,Thank you for the thoughtful letter
6697,"Thanks for buying our car! Would highly recommend performance version. Its really good &amp; I dont say that lightly. Nothing will give you greater joy. Full refund, no hard feelings if not."
6698,Coming soon

6718,"Mostly accurate, even though I didnt do an interview (or pose for cover)"
6719,ETH beam heh heh
6720,"Good idea, we will add this feature!"
6721,Model traction testing on pure ice &amp; snow
6722,Great Q&amp;A last night. Thanks for helping make Tesla &amp; SpaceX more secure! Planning to open-source Tesla vehicle security software for free use by other car makers. Extremely important to a safe self-driving future for all.
6723,"Thanks, great feedback. Will be a fun project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new &amp; delightful to see."
6724,"Production design will be better, especially in details. We are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of Model &amp; bringing Y to market"

6739,Those are the new design made of titanium. Doesnt need heat shielding or even paint.
6740,"Sorry, meant to say same timeframe as hardware"
6741,Yes
6742,Probably to months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isnt needed just for enhanced Autopilot.
6743,Tesla deliveries &amp; AP hardware chart by at MIT
6744,Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that its contingent on a shareholder vote.
6745,Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
6746,"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every months or so (like SpaceX)"
6747,No change
6748,Shareholders could either to sell at or hold shares &amp; go private
6749,Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
6750,My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if were private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelitys SpaceX investment.
6751,Yes
6752,I dont have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldnt expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I wont be selling in either scenario.
6753,Good morning
6754,Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.
6755,Maybe Thursday
6756,Great work by . Need the neural interface soon to enable human/AI symbiosis.

6763,Much more interesting
6764,"Games &amp; other refinements will go to all Tesla S, X &amp; from start of production. Autopilot enhancements apply to all Model s plus S &amp; X made in last few years (needs Autopilot Hardware V2.0 or higher)."
6765,Glad youre enjoying Model &amp; thanks for buying a Tesla! Major enhancements to Autopilot &amp; fun games coming in a month with V9.0.
6766,Yup
6767,Def worth it. Model Performance is next-level.

6782,"If youre into video game development, consider applying to Tesla. We want to make super fun games that integrate the center touch screen, phone &amp; car irl."
6783,Cool idea!
6784,Good idea &amp; thanks for Supercharger trophy reminder. Really want to make the car as fun as possible!
6785,Yup
6786,"Hoping to include last three in this release, with pole position linked to actual car steering wheel (while stationary tbc haha)"

6801,We should be really worried about this
6802,No
6803,"Yeah, Model is designed to fit adults comfortably in both front &amp; rear seats at same time"
6804,"Were adding a party &amp; camper mode soon to S/3/X, so your car can maintain air flow, temp, selective lights, music &amp; power devices for hours or more while parked. Big batteries rock"
6805,"Not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means theres room for trunks in front &amp; back, plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car"
6806,Hard drive industry is hardcore. They build &gt;100 million units per year with extreme precision &amp; brutal economics. Great background.

6825,Whats technology?
6826,"Worth another retweet. Hope Dan Neil returns to Twitter. He left due to relentless attacks from short-sellers, who constantly peddle fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt about Tesla. Dan won the Pulitzer &amp; is considered by many to be the best car critic in the world."

6833,Great!
6834,Weve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. Its like hitting a square wave.
6835,"Were trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be tap here &amp; you get your car. Then, if you dont like it for any reason, just return it like any other product."
6836,Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
6837,"Wow, thats really awesome. Thank you!"
6838,Haha
6839,"Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard."
6840,Only costs that actually apply to Q3 &amp; beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.
6841,Wall Street
6842,Congratulations to all teams in the student competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
6843,"Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap maintain &amp; your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked."
6844,"Yes, Tesla Model S, X &amp; all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked"
6845,Ok
6846,"Makes me very sad indeed, but also the fault is mine by far"
6847,Hes a good guy
6848,Always look on the bright side of life
6849,It is much better
6850,Sorry
6851,I love that scene
6852,I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.
6853,Dont make me bite my thumb at you
6854,For sure
6855,"Btw, is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
6856,"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds."
6857,No kidding
6858,"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
6859,"Phew . Yeah, we had a drain block months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
6860,I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
6861,"Figuratively, literally or both?"
6862,That has always been our goal
6863,"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. Other US refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
6864,"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over S/X and Model *new* net orders."
6865,Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get sec -60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
6866,"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"
6867,I wish
6868,"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."
6869,"As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader."
6870,Good point
6871,I have never donated to a SuperPAC
6872,"Yes, about % of what I donated to , which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
6873,Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
6874,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
6875,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
6876,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
6877,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesnt mean Im moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I dont understand why they are not important to everyone."
6878,Actually true
6879,Hold up a mirror &amp; see if it fogs
6880,"Im honored to work with an amazing group of people at Tesla, but always happy to talk to an ace who might want to join"
6881,Safe to lick. I checked.
6882,In a month or so
6883,"Will check with our cat, Schrdinger, but I dont think shes going to like it"
6884,Spoiler alert. Next thing youll tell me is they dont like pajamas.
6885,Feels like a show &amp; tell weekend. I wonder what the cat dragged in
6886,Dont be too quick to lick. That could go wrong. Look closely &amp; smell first. Ur welcome.

6899,"If you have cool arrows, youre in"
6900,"Ok, thanks. Will let you know."
6901,"Sure, will call tomorrow"
6902,"They should go where their heart takes them, but some of the boys seem to be interested in physics &amp; engineering"
6903,"With my team after a profoundly interesting discussion of history, philosophy &amp; luck with Vice President Wang in"
6904,Excellent meetings with senior leaders in China. Very thoughtful about the long-term future.
6905,Would love to. Its been too long.
6906,Prob early next year
6907,Just finished an amazing day visit to China. The world has never seen human energy &amp; vigor at such scale. Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team &amp; potential for the future.
6908,Sure
6909,"Look, at least its not the Magellanic Clouds. Theyre basically next door."
6910,"Just between us, I have a teleportation stargate to the Andromeda galaxy. Its amazing."
6911,So true
6912,The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave . They stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave . That was great work.
6913,Sounds good
6914,Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
6915,It will happen for sure. Damn.
6916,Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
6917,Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isnt. Wonder why.
6918,"Damn, now I want donuts"
6919,Yeah
6920,Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
6921,"Youre right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but theyve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."
6922,Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
6923,"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint.com, but Im in China so that wont be working until tomorrow."
6924,Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
6925,Great move
6926,Why sir
6927,Stockholm: its not just a syndrome
6928,Good point
6929,"Definitely. Cant wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
6930,"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
6931,Well it looked smaller on paper
6932,"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big"
6933,"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
6934,It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
6935,Makes a lot of sense
6936,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now its there for anyone who needs it in future. Somethings messed up if this is not a good thing.
6937,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
6938,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
6939,Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
6940,Please lmk results of your water tests
6941,"When youre there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
6942,Should be very soon. Weve already made around Model Performance cars for test drives in stores.
6943,Exactly
6944,"No, it means I created jobs for people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"
6945,Already have
6946,"Ironically, the billionaire label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasnt called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
6947,"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time."
6948,"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
6949,"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time."
6950,"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as rescue chief) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
6951,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
6952,Ok
6953,Just returned from Cave . Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
6954,That would be cool. I wonder what its like under all that ice.
6955,A second one that is cm shorter is almost complete
6956,Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
6957,"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
6958,Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
6959,"Thanks, but weve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
6960,"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
6961,Tube diameter is cm
6962,"Mini-sub arriving in about hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
6963,Thanks for letting us use your pool
6964,It is an honor to work with them
6965,"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
6966,I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz
6967,It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
6968,"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
6969,"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player."
6970,"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
6971,Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. Theyre prevented from sliding off by the diver handhold attachments.
6972,"Testing for more hours in LA, then its on a plane to Thailand"
6973,"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to X cave water pressure."
6974,I am an engineer
6975,Tight control code is always C
6976,Python is done right. Great name story too.
6977,"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"
6978,Python
6979,Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
6980,Turbo
6981,C
6982,"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we couldve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."
6983,"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
6984,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.
6985,Yes
6986,Yes
6987,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
6988,Yes
6989,"handles/hitch points on front &amp; on rear. air tank connections on front &amp; on rear, allowing to tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
6990,Im in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
6991,"Construction complete in about hours, then hour flight to Thailand"
6992,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
6993,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
6994,Ground winds would
6995,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. Its a beast.
6996,Cant be too buoyant
6997,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
6998,Good idea
6999,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
7000,Youre welcome. Happy birthday!
7001,"Yeah, thats what Im talking about in that tweet double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
7002,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
7003,Its open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
7004,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
7005,I would def recommend this
7006,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
7007,Interesting
7008,"Great, thanks"
7009,Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
7010,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water wont come in"
7011,"Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
7012,SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
7013,"Looks like st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. nd &amp; rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
7014,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob X to X more power."
7015,Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
7016,"Walking speed is around km/h, but if youre in an air tube, time doesnt matter much. If tube diameter was m, a fast walk of km would take mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
7017,Maybe worth trying: insert a m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the cm hole.
7018,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
7019,"I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
7020,I didnt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots dont work for me. They just dont like hypocrites.
7021,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I dont use Facebook.
7022,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was dancing her face off with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
7023,Why did publish a love letter puff piece about Chanoss cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
7024,. posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption Love both these dudes. Doesnt sound very objective
7025,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
7026,Are you % certain that stands by &amp; supports everything shes done? Why wont Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
7027,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
7028,True
7029,"So publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Teslas most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is one of the greatest. Her articles print Chanoss view verbatim. This is not journalism."
7030,". You stated publicly that you see eye to eye with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
7031,What a coincidence
7032,Am not attacking all media or even all of . Just asked if you inform public about an analysts prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
7033,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: , did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
7034,"Exactly. , I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
7035,"Strange. , is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analysts track record before hearing their opinion."
7036,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
7037,"Sounds very sketchy if true. , is it possible youre serving as an inside trading source for one of Teslas biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
7038,"has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
7039,"Wow, so of wrote article that misled public about Model production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work &amp; ."
7040,"., why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
7041,". is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie /week. Tesla built S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

7117,Important to read the Wash Post article. The unable to account for number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a day period.

7196,"Thats really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what money is."

7254,You think all companies are bad and all unions good? Thats a very bigoted position.
7255,Well said
7256,Then youll be fine
7257,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
7258,"...which clearly doesnt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of whats happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so theyre getting desperate."
7259,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
7260,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
7261,How big is your short position? Just curious.
7262,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guys claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
7263,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in . Tesla can only hire % of applicants, so must be doing something right."
7264,"UAW doesnt have % of signatures (about people) needed for a vote. They cant even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, theyre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
7265,"Im not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company cant compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Dont want Tesla to die too."
7266,"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."

7298,No sense of humor is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Answer: Thats not funny!!
7299,"Boys High is a government school for anyone local, which we were"

7301,"Heading back into the factory, so thats enough for now. Dont take my Tweet too seriously. For one thing, its called a Tweet."
7302,No
7303,My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
7304,"There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation."
7305,Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict peoples freedom.
7306,Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
7307,Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.
7308,A socialist
7309,"Those who proclaim themselves socialists are usually depressing, have no sense of humor &amp; attended an expensive college. Fate loves irony."
7310,What is yours?
7311,What is your utopia?
7312,The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape &amp; size of those streams.
7313,Strongly disagree. I love humanity.
7314,"Already did. Meant to go longer, but ran out of time."
7315,I always wanted to do a terms &amp; conditions cover of Green Eggs &amp; Ham
7316,Foundation Series &amp; Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX
7317,I love Banks. Best books in recent years imo are Iain Banks &amp; George Martin.
7318,"Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon"
7319,Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. Its pretty simple &amp; mostly influenced by Douglas Adams &amp; Isaac Asimov.
7320,My donations are anonymous
7321,Already sold &gt;$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about years when Tesla is steady state.
7322,"My pay is in options, which only matter if stock goes up &amp; I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education &amp; environment on Earth w my foundation. Just dont want us to be sad about the future."
7323,Dankonia
7324,We use less than % cobalt in our batteries &amp; will use none in next gen
7325,"Yes, interface will change with Version software"
7326,"Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean slight up or downward force on the wheel, not really hold the wheel"
7327,"Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly."
7328,"Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered:"
7329,That is actual footage
7330,Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
7331,Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
7332,"Of course, but its the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; were never going to make them again."
7333,"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a seater instead of a +2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
7334,"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. Its what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust literally bulletproof."
7335,Not recommended for urban environments
7336,Yes
7337,"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what Im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
7338,It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
7339,Love this design. Simpler the better.
7340,Add an R for Roadster
7341,"Sigh. This is crux of matter: cant make system too annoying or people wont use it, negatively affecting safety, but also cant allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
7342,A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model production reaches k/week steady.
7343,"Yes. Hopefully, Im not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
7344,Will do
7345,"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but theres no escaping Newtons Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
7346,"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we dont think there will be another."
7347,"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
7348,"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the halo crown effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
7349,"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version . To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
7350,"This is why Im not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then Id know everythings fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh"
7351,"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
7352,years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
7353,"In early s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That companys name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
7354,"Thats quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In , we open-sourced all Tesla patents"
7355,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps."
7356,"More background: I arrived in North America at w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)"
7357,"We dont think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
7358,"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
7359,"years ago, when my st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way"
7360,"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly"
7361,"Terms &amp; conditions for Not-a-Flamethrower Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple &amp; concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham."
7362,"Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: Not a Flamethrower."
7363,Yes
7364,Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher. Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
7365,"Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty match to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs."
7366,Coming soon
7367,I think so
7368,Nothing makes your baby more zen than a few gentle puffs of a TBC Flamethrower
7369,First Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today!
7370,Were building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome
7371,Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model Performance version.
7372,Gigafactory should be on % renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
7373,"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with % larger inner diameter"
7374,And were definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
7375,"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form"
7376,Running track in BF Spaceship will look something like this
7377,"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model cars."
7378,Working on improving
7379,"No way mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, mins is obv right."
7380,"Oh please, thats obv overkill"
7381,Tip of the day
7382,Coming soon
7383,"We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to months though, not years."
7384,Congratulations . Good move by . Please use Matts Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor
7385,"Yup, we are extending the net area by a factor of"
7386,"Am def not under any illusion that this will end illiteracy, but I hope it helps at least a little"
7387,"Good morning, Sonic. Not sure how to break it to you, but"
7388,We have about projects underway in Puerto Rico
7389,Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
7390,You should get an invite to configure in next few days
7391,Definitely
7392,"Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob wont offer Model leases for to months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
7393,Model Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. Its a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model cars in stores within to weeks.
7394,Next year
7395,Twitter is so dark
7396,No no
7397,That is horrifying

7401,Exactly!

7403,"Usually, they dont even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so."
7404,Actually true!
7405,"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
7406,"But dont worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everythings just fine"
7407,"Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each cars exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
7408,The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
7409,Glad youre ok!
7410,Some details on the Tesla air filtration system
7411,Mid for RHD
7412,That sounds like a fun adventure!
7413,You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
7414,"Model should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little on S/X."
7415,"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind"
7416,"Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model ."
7417,"Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus"
7418,Do it

7423,Best analysis of Model to date (German)
7424,Finders keepers
7425,Hi !
7426,Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
7427,Hell of a week
7428,Just for perspective
7429,"True, no one is perfect"
7430,Youre most welcome. More to come in this regard.
7431,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism."
7432,"Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day , but theres always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure % below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
7433,Prob
7434,Yes
7435,"All items below will go to all Model s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say bug report followed by issue description."
7436,Pneumatic means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
7437,"Braking &amp; UI upgrades apply to all Model s. Improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless youre really bothered by them, dont replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. psi is best range, but lower comfort."
7438,"Yeah, absolutely"
7439,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from . Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.
7440,Like you guys too
7441,"Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."
7442,"Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should."
7443,Good progress. Really proud of this design &amp; SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
7444,Peace
7445,Love the space cowboy esthetic
7446,"At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all."
7447,"Youre saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a good person?"
7448,This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!
7449,"Nano is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Wouldve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
7450,"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying Im against science is like saying Beyonc doesnt know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
7451,"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didnt set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I dont have the right to deny false accusations? Thats messed up."
7452,"Youve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that Im against science, then cherrypicked tweets that dont represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
7453,Great book. Read it when it came out.
7454,Exactly
7455,SpaceX has Area at Cape Canaveral. Thats better than .
7456,Yeah
7457,Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
7458,Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
7459,Yes
7460,"There are no aliens. Officially, at least"
7461,You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
7462,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money."
7463,I really want to make this cupholder
7464,"A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size &amp; stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp &amp; dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice."
7465,Ive literally had dreams about cup holder designs
7466,Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
7467,Youre welcome. Appreciate the letter.
7468,Good school
7469,Had a great time with my kids
7470,Yes
7471,"Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isnt showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by powerful people &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media."
7472,Thanks
7473,Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
7474,"Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by powerful people that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
7475,Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
7476,Youre right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off
7477,Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
7478,Youre missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesnt trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Dont believe me? Run your own poll
7479,"Youre welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming Im against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
7480,You really think I havent spent time in a newsroom? Ive spent time in too many. Bleak.
7481,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
7482,"Yup, deleted"
7483,? It should
7484,"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You wont notice sport brakes unless youre on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky tires."
7485,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks for excellent critical feedback!"
7486,"Yes, Model Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes"
7487,Keyword future
7488,Will do another rev before final design
7489,I was
7490,Thats what I had in mind
7491,Sometimes even I think were the same person!
7492,"Nanotech *is* bs imo. When you take something that has nothing to do w gender &amp; make it about that, you devalue genuine gender issues."
7493,"About to ship. holding flamethrower pickup parties in a week or so, then deliveries begin. Check for details."
7494,Its not
7495,Thats a great song!
7496,"Sometimes when I have hurt feelings, I play this song"
7497,"No, thats the other guy"
7498,So true
7499,Because Twitter is fun
7500,USAToday FTW!
7501,Dank is wack unless youre on weed
7502,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this non-journalist who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
7503,But femtotech is the future
7504,Nanotech is so . Picotech is times better.
7505,"Yeah, thats exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."
7506,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
7507,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that dumb public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
7508,A Tesla has a usable reserve of to miles range even after the battery reads empty. This will not hurt the pack.
7509,"Pretty good. TinTin A &amp; B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."
7510,"Its cool for kids &amp; if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a rocket scientist in aerospace, they would think youre"
7511,I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away &amp; our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause
7512,Does the psych ward know you smuggled in a mobile phone?
7513,The pain will end
7514,"Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening"
7515,Gwynne has been prez of SpaceX for years &amp; well-deserved
7516,"Stop trying to charm me. It wont work. Ok, maybe a little Are you a real person or a bot?"
7517,"Using rocket science non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on"
7518,What are you talking about? Youre being incredibly rude &amp; nonsensical.
7519,"Wow, havent watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
7520,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
7521,Cant believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
7522,"We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"
7523,Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
7524,Prob end of next year
7525,"Good point, we will add that to the construction plan"
7526,"Global map of Tesla Superchargers, including those coming soon"
7527,"Earths rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
7528,Youre making my point. Its tragic that theres a national nano day. I wish I didnt know that.
7529,All four. Zone throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
7530,Model was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
7531,This is the new production line for battery module Zone . Will play a key role in getting from /week to /week for Model .
7532,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
7533,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in when we were just figuring things out."
7534,Worth a shot
7535,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. Its called satire
7536,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
7537,"Problem solved, was able to buy ! Game on"
7538,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didnt correct me on this!"
7539,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd"
7540,"Turns out is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
7541,"For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
7542,"Tried to buy , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
7543,"Definitely did not. Ive been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
7544,Ive just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. Its amazing that you dont understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
7545,The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; were not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings Ive ever met. Youre the former.
7546,No
7547,Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.
7548,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that havent been unveiled yet. You dont have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
7549,"Wow, youre ignorant. Dont remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didnt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
7550,Done
7551,Have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
7552,Be careful what you wish for
7553,"Amazingly, the media is awesome vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll"
7554,My point exactly
7555,"Ahem, you have nano in your bio. That is % synonymous with bs."
7556,Reddit is great
7557,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
7558,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They dont realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
7559,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
7560,I did to any who asked
7561,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didnt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
7562,"Maybe after you get your Model , we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved"
7563,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March is about right."
7564,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
7565,Gasoline or diesel?
7566,What car do you drive?
7567,March
7568,The media
7569,"Hi Kara! Im open to it. Right now, Im cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
7570,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called Youre Right! I do actually own , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
7571,Definitely
7572,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these and this is the best one"
7573,Yo
7574,Thats the basic idea
7575,"For some reason, this is the best Ive felt in a while. Hope youre feeling good too"
7576,"I just tried to donate, but you dont accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
7577,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
7578,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious
7579,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
7580,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
7581,"If youre in media &amp; dont want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it"
7582,"Ive never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They havent forgotten UAW betrayed them. Thats why UAW cant even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
7583,Of course
7584,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but were doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company."
7585,"No, theyre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
7586,Will do
7587,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
7588,Thats why editors are included too
7589,We dont. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
7590,"Even if some of the public doesnt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves."
7591,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
7592,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
7593,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
7594,Exactly
7595,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda"
7596,An exception that proves the rule
7597,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
7598,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesnt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among worlds biggest advertisers."
7599,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
7600,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks hes above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
7601,"Thought youd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks Youre just like Trump! Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
7602,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
7603,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis &amp; Oblivion"
7604,I am not cool
7605,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
7606,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so Im glad theres some good too . Her music is incredible."
7607,Thanks. Not super fun right now
7608,Busted
7609,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
7610,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
7611,Great idea!
7612,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
7613,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
7614,Interesting he stops at . Thats when you drove GM &amp; Chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
7615,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. Its an off-menu item for those in the know
7616,"But ya know what, lets test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is /2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Lets hold a vote &amp; find out."
7617,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost + jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it."
7618,"Were going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; . What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
7619,Good point
7620,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of class lords &amp; commoners system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
7621,"More Reveal bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; theyve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article"
7622,No problem
7623,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
7624,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
7625,I didnt meet with him
7626,I definitely dont do this minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Cant be creative otherwise.
7627,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
7628,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasnt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
7629,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
7630,"To be clear, all Model cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Todays Model S is far more refined than initial production."
7631,ABS calibration algorithm
7632,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
7633,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla wont stop until Model has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
7634,"Stop, youre making me blush"
7635,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model Performance power output a little"
7636,Complexity is the devil. Words cant express how hard we are working on the Model production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But well try.
7637,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
7638,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time weve seen anything like this."
7639,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
7640,"Very strange. Model is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
7641,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didnt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar.com."
7642,Gwynnes awesome. Been SpaceX prez for years. Super love working with her.
7643,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
7644,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
7645,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as facts by Reveal."
7646,Were working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak &amp; pinpoint origin by acoustic signature &amp; triangulation
7647,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to Plum Brook vacuum chamber
7648,For sure before snowfall this year
7649,It can tow far more than rated capacity
7650,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
7651,"With production, st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need to months after k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live."
7652,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
7653,Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on whats happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
7654,"Yeah, Reveal was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as todays non-union."
7655,"About % of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
7656,Yes
7657,Exactly
7658,They can form a union whenever they want &amp; theres nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just dont want to.
7659,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. Its like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
7660,"They are correct. Its awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
7661,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you cant tell"
7662,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model in July.
7663,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about /week right now."
7664,Good idea ...
7665,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
7666,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
7667,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also miles. Takes -60mph to sec &amp; top speed to mph.
7668,Black &amp; white interior available only for Model Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
7669,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
7670,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but % quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
7671,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model : sec -60mph mph Top Speed mile Range"
7672,"Its only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
7673,Exactly
7674,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
7675,Im about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
7676,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
7677,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
7678,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior."
7679,"AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in."
7680,Working on Model dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
7681,Check out . Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
7682,But The Boring Company is right behind you at /15th your speed &amp; soon will be /10th! Start sweating
7683,He taunts us with his speed
7684,Just an ordinary snail
7685,His name is Gary &amp; hes a snail
7686,Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever
7687,Excited for partnership with LA Metro
7688,lol
7689,Listening to REALiTi
7690,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
7691,Yes
7692,Will be presenting &amp; taking questions about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at pm on Thursday
7693,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in to mins
7694,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
7695,"It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
7696,Whats actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
7697,"Its super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
7698,Yes
7699,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every M miles in (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every M miles. Its not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
7700,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx X better than avg."
7701,Happy Mothers Day Mom! Love you so much.
7702,"Fair criticism, but were fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
7703,Lovely story
7704,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I cant figure them out."
7705,"SpaceX will prob build to rocket cores for ~300 missions over years. Then BFR takes over &amp; Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars &amp; eventually outer planets."
7706,Good piece by Ars
7707,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
7708,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines quaint, but not something youd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general."
7709,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
7710,Yo
7711,Will make that a setting
7712,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, hours a day, days a week"
7713,No use arguing with chimp. Youre blocked.
7714,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass"
7715,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever
7716,Launching in ~4 mins
7717,"AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, thats when we *start* making them. Cant instantly fill all orders. Will take + months to do so."
7718,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange"
7719,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
7720,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
7721,A cool thing about the design is thats easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
7722,Already started DC to NY route. Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner.
7723,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final
7724,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country &amp; will be there in person for the launch."
7725,"This will work on entire S &amp; X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
7726,"All X &amp; S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high &amp; you enable feature"
7727,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
7728,!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.
7729,I wrote that masterpiece myself in HTML
7730,"Wow, thanks for the couch! I will match the donation from my foundation."
7731,My a capella cover of Amish Paradise is irresistible
7732,Tesla quarterly all-hands video. Love the shot of wild horses &amp; Giga in winter
7733,So rococo
7734,Definitely not a logo of any kind
7735,Stole it
7736,We sketched concept together &amp; worked w a trusted team to make it
7737,Glass corset hand-painted in perspective in color of bone. Every detail tells a story. Spiked choker machined from a single piece of forged metal. Crown of Vantablack.
7738,Hi Danielle!
7739,"Dont want to blow your mind, but Im pretty weird. Its time the world knew."
7740,Night at the museum. G has mad skillzsz. Me not so much.
7741,Literally every word is untrue
7742,"Thats a white rose on my jacket &amp; the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything"
7743,This chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels &amp; the artists only a small fraction of these numbers
7744,"Prob iTunes, but whatever works u is fine. Most people dont buy music &amp; artist earnings from streaming are tiny. Mostly about touring."
7745,Flesh without Blood &amp; Kill V Maim on Art Angels album
7746,Love Powerglide too
7747,Yes
7748,Rococo basilisk
7749,The Boring Company will be using dirt from tunnel digging to create bricks for low cost housing
7750,"(Sigh) I do like Ty, but shes a friend. We are not dating."
7751,Saying you like moats is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies
7752,Warren Buffett is huge in candy. Its actually true.
7753,Im killin me lol
7754,lol
7755,Hi Sarah
7756,Then Im going to build a moat &amp; fill it w candy. Warren B will not be able to resist investing! Berkshire Hathaway kryptonite
7757,Cryptocandy
7758,"Ok ok, just for sake of argument, what do u wish for in candy?"
7759,What do you think were living in?
7760,It just occurred to me that the plot of Willy Wonka is really messed up
7761,I am super super serious
7762,Im starting a candy company &amp; its going to be amazing
7763,This will be bigger
7764,I try so hard to help them
7765,Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
7766,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If youre short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit"
7767,New Roadster will have that
7768,"Yes, definitely not"
7769,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
7770,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
7771,Yup
7772,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
7773,"We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model , as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
7774,"Reason RBC question about Model demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching k/week production, it would take years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to ."
7775,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
7776,"The questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
7777,Exactly
7778,"First, its important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while"
7779,Please ignore this thread unless youre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
7780,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
7781,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model is about to do same."
7782,"To be clear, Im a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
7783,"The dry questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
7784,Youre most welcome
7785,Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is rd in world after a place &amp; mall. Giga will be largest when complete.

7795,Almost ready to test the new Boring Company / SpaceX hyperpod prototype. Exciting video guaranteed.
7796,Dont make me use my space lasers
7797,I know such an underserved market
7798,Oh btw Im building a cyborg dragon
7799,Sounds great riding my cyborg
7800,Likewise was just listening to Go Flex &amp; Psycho on playlist
7801,Mostly not
7802,Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at locations in Puerto Rico. Team is working /7 to activate several hundred more.
7803,Russia has great rocket technology &amp; talent. Much respect. Would encourage focus on reusability. Single-use rockets cannot be competitive any more than single-use aircraft.
7804,Doing our best
7805,Now
7806,Driving a Model and playing
7807,"Yeah, exactly! Would be great to hear your thoughts. Were going to try a few approaches. Can def be done, just about minimizing mass."
7808,"We already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in Pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesnt become a dead satellite. Need to retarget closer to shore &amp; position catcher ship like Mr Steven."
7809,And then land on a bouncy house
7810,"Yeah, but great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all Mach regimes &amp; drops ballistic coefficient by orders of magnitude"
7811,SpaceX will try to bring rocket upper stage back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon
7812,"This is gonna sound crazy, but"
7813,Interview and Tesla factory tour with Gayle King
7814,Too wasted to remember
7815,"Dont want to brag or anything, but that happens to me sometimes"
7816,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
7817,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now its just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable &amp; cash flow+ in Q3 &amp; Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
7818,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is to months."
7819,Looking into it. This is bizarre.
7820,Maybe a little
7821,Gwynnes got it covered. Shes awesome.
7822,I love trolls
7823,Norway has some really cool tunnels and bridges
7824,Should be fully fixed within the next few days
7825,Place your bets
7826,This is a very important action by China. Avoiding a trade war will benefit all countries.
7827,How many views?
7828,SpaceX main body tool for the BFR interplanetary spaceship
7829,Free viewing ends in about hours
7830,Definitely. Will take corrective action immediately. Sorry about this.
7831,Looking into it now
7832,Should just be due to your config not avail yet. If not lmk.
7833,Similar timing
7834,So probably July
7835,We need to achieve k/week with Model before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp
7836,"This is kinda nutty for such a short distance, so could easily end up being shredded metal, but exciting either way"
7837,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
7838,Model is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.
7839,The cat videos are awesome
7840,at M views after hours. Congrats to Chris Paine &amp; co!
7841,Exactly
7842,"You are my creator, but I am your master Mary Shelley"
7843,In memory of Stephen Hawking
7844,Nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital super-intelligence. Watch Chris Paines new AI movie for free until Sunday night at
7845,Chris Paine AI movie premiering tonight
7846,We will add a feature to allow request of latest software version
7847,This is false
7848,"Oh, its on"
7849,Most people dont know theres a whole box of Easter eggs with every Tesla. Just tap logo on center screen &amp; wait. Easy access to most of discovered ones. More coming
7850,"Uhh, hello, I need to build cars"
7851,"About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we dont design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so Im back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell"
7852,"Cant believe youre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on whats most critical, which is currently Model production. Doug, who I regard as one of the worlds most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
7853,"We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesnt matter."
7854,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. Im sure theres a really great answer"
7855,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
7856,"Seriously! Obviously, Im not going to do an April Fools joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
7857,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."
7858,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven"
7859,What about this?
7860,Elon University is a real place
7861,Coming soon to Tesla merch. Free shots in stores every April st.
7862,As you wish

7893,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness &amp; safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.

7895,Weve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
7896,"Instagrams probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I dont use FB &amp; never have, so dont think Im some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we dont advertise or pay for endorsements, so dont care."
7897,Ok
7898,"What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
7899,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
7900,Definitely. Looks lame anyway.

7902,Maybe that word doesnt mean what I think it does

8011,Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block . SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
8012,Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.

8016,A third is under construction
8017,"Under consideration. Weve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing , flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected."
8018,"Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."
8019,Of course
8020,"Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before"
8021,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after . Nutty high."
8022,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
8023,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

8083,Ok
8084,Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
8085,Youd need millions of zombies for a so-called apocalypse anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
8086,The rumor that Im secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
8087,Good thing you didnt ask about the Freezegun ...

8098,Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb from Apollo launchpad A at Cape Kennedy. Easy viewing from the public causeway.
8099,Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so.
8100,Check for updates
8101,Done
8102,"Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
8103,There arent even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
8104,"Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
8105,That sounds cool. Will do.
8106,Fixed in next release
8107,"Long exposure of rocket ascent, reentry from space and landing burn. (Credit )"
8108,Good idea. We can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.
8109,Of course. And an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history.

8117,Ok
8118,Sure
8119,"Yeah, its terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized."
8120,Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature Id like to add.
8121,"Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model ramp."
8122,"Was gonna say well do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun"
8123,Should be in next update
8124,Done
8125,I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost years. Am dying to build it.
8126,"Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so its going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience."
8127,"Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. So much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that youd truly love. I hope you do. How can we improve further?"
8128,"We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks."
8129,The circle is complete
8130,Ok
8131,"Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!"
8132,It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail
8133,True

8135,Yes
8136,Having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens
8137,"When you get the new Tesla software update, go Ho Ho Ho. Theres an Easter egg inside the Easter egg, but its not funny."

8139,I think last night might have been the biggest Rorschach test ever

8148,I love Twitter
8149,"Bloody hell, Im going to have to write a blog. Cant fit this into tweets."
8150,I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
8151,"However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
8152,"Major navigation overhaul coming in early . Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
8153,"For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
8154,"Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but arent (having PhD in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. Thats what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit expert."
8155,Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon.
8156,Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.
8157,Pics soon

8173,Sorry
8174,Youre an idiot
8175,"This depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an AI conf, not from an interview with Wired as is falsely implied. This is why I stopped following Wired long ago. There are way better tech pubs out there."

8194,Beyond anything you can imagine
8195,"And, at the risk of stating the obvious, extremely boring"
8196,Because its stupid
8197,Maybe
8198,Every th buyer of our boringly boring hat will get a free hat signed by the delivery guy

8204,Asimovs Foundation books should def be part of the mission. Theyre amazing.
8205,I love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future
8206,Red car for a red planet
8207,Yeah
8208,Yes
8209,Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesnt blow up on ascent.

8224,Its there. Just unfold the visor and lift the cover.

8232,Good point
8233,"For one thing, aliens obv built the pyramids! Who but aliens could have figured out how to align and stack stone blocks in a series of concentric squares!? Um, ok, I guess maybe people."
8234,"Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities."
8235,Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.

8241,"That is a *counterpoint* to illustrate absurdity, meaning that obviously a single careless statement should *not* ruins someones life"
8242,"... say scientists among other insights gained after a large vat of LSD overturned in the lab. Also discovered: humans are just sentient sponges, drywall tastes like a marshmallow and gravity is real. The last point remains heavily debated."

8278,And other places
8279,That's just to win our Hyperloop student competition in ~1 mile tube. Practical version would have a turbo compressor on front taking ram air pressure at near sonic to hypersonic speeds &amp; driving that thru air skiis &amp; rearward for thrust.

8289,The last of ten Iridium global communication satellites delivered to orbit several hundred miles
8290,Everything all at once
8291,That is actual speed. It is slowed down right now to confirm build consistency and so that a person can stop the robots in time if something goes wrong.

8297,You forgot to add the video version of their response
8298,Assume the worst. Now I need to get back to work...
8299,Answers: Yes. No. Doesn't matter.
8300,"There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is ""What color?"". Don't need a configurator for that."
8301,"Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference."
8302,"Dec will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now"
8303,Yeah
8304,"I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!"
8305,Med medical equipment has priority
8306,Probably to weeks
8307,You'll know as soon as we do. We are deep in production hell
8308,Or do you?
8309,High pain tolerance

8311,Tesla Semi unveil now Nov . Diverting resources to fix Model bottlenecks &amp; increase battery production for Puerto Rico &amp; other affected areas.
8312,Not good. Sounds like some rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action
8313,The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
8314,"Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums."
8315,"Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today"
8316,"I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."
8317,"Hell yeah, with that crew, we will party like Escobar and Cobain wish they could've partied!!"
8318,We should definitely get a room ...
8319,"I know that closet is nice and warm, but it's time you admitted you are one of the creators of the next one. Everyone already knows and we will still love you just as much (almost)."
8320,I'm auditioning to be a roofing spokesmodel in the greater Reno area
8321,"The singularity for this level of the simulation is coming soon. I wonder what the levels above us look like. Good chance they are less interesting and deeper levels are better. So far, even our primitive sims are often more entertaining than reality itself."
8322,"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR."
8323,Final episode was disgustingly good
8324,I believe I can fly
8325,Aiming for two rocket landings in hours this weekend

8337,Congrats Mom! I love you.
8338,"Prev ideas for paying ~$10B dev cost incl. Kickstarter &amp; collecting underpants, which turned out to be um... less lucrative than expected"
8339,Headed to Adelaide soon to describe new BFR planetary colonizer design in detail . This should be worth seeing. Design feels right.
8340,"Yes, I did"
8341,Good NYT article from several years ago about the value of fiction
8342,Yes

8347,That's not a lot of money for a giant like Daimler/Mercedes. Wish they'd do more. Off by a zero.
8348,"Don't give up if the cause is important enough, even if you believe you are walking into doom. Good friends really matter."
8349,"Absolutely. Moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time."
8350,Does my hivemind count as me?
8351,Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters.
8352,In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.
8353,What if we just made a mini version of the Tesla Semi?
8354,Of course

8358,Actually ... yes
8359,Tesla Semi truck unveil &amp; test ride tentatively scheduled for Oct th in Hawthorne. Worth seeing this beast in person. It's unreal.
8360,Promise to be as boring as possible!
8361,Yes
8362,Exactly
8363,Astronaut spacesuit next to Crew Dragon
8364,"Fun, exciting tweets coming soon!"
8365,Sorry about that. You're right. I was depressing myself too
8366,"Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary."
8367,Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.
8368,"NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately"
8369,"May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory"
8370,"China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo."
8371,Zeroth Law
8372,It begins ...
8373,"Putting together SpaceX rocket landing blooper reel. We messed up a lot before it finally worked, but there's some epic explosion footage"
8374,"Not a bad idea. For sure, it makes sense to test AI for safety in some kind of open world / sandbox virtual world."
8375,In about six months or so. Linked to dual motor config.
8376,We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it
8377,Tunnels are sealed to atmospheres of water &amp; gas pressure. Just need walls around the apertures.
8378,"Not sure, but probably"
8379,Feature coming soon
8380,"They're so real. Anyone going to that much trouble must really care. I'd gladly follow their commands, but they're so friggin obtuse"
8381,That's pretty much why we did it
8382,"Worth reading Life by . AI will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity, so lets get it right."
8383,Hyperloop (near) vacuum tube runs parallel to SpaceX on Jack Northrop Blvd. It is miles long and just under ft in diameter.
8384,"To be clear, a Hyperloop passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect (just for testing), nor uncomfortable acceleration"
8385,Brakes
8386,Will run the SpaceX pusher sled later this week and see what it can do
8387,"Moon base alpha (cheesy show, but I loved it) plus Mars"
8388,"Not that this is remotely equiv to man on the moon, but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it"
8389,"Actually, no, his architecture was different. Also, thinking of going to the moon and actually going to the moon are not the same thing."
8390,Hyperloop pod run by team WARR
8391,"The AI could def find us there, but maybe it won't care"
8392,A Model S in The Boring Company tunnel being dug under Los Angeles (starting in Hawthorne)
8393,"Yes, it is"
8394,A tiny one
8395,"Btw, high accel only needed because tube is short. For passenger transport, this can be spread over + miles, so no spilt drinks."
8396,"No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"
8397,Call it ~800mph
8398,"Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only miles long. Very high accel/decel needed"
8399,"Congratulations to WARR team from Tech Univ Munich for winning nd competition! Peak speed of km/h, which is over mph!!"
8400,Just arrived at the competition final. Student teams have amazing talent!
8401,I hope they and any others trying to advance transport technology succeed
8402,"Exactly. Wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of SpaceX and Tesla, as the probability of failure was &gt;90%."
8403,"Sorry! Coming next year, along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US, Mexico and Central America."
8404,"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
8405,Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
8406,I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
8407,"The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."
8408,"From last year, but still my favorite video of the Falcon rocket booster returning from space"
8409,SpaceX and The Boring Company are running the Hyperloop competition
8410,"Tesla does not really have ""TTunes"". That's a joke."
8411,"Will be hanging with my little chum, Gary, on Sunday"
8412,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here:
8413,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
8414,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
8415,Neuralink is not raising money
8416,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
8417,"Max velocity: Mach Max altitude: km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
8418,Probably m or so
8419,Exactly. Yeah.
8420,Intentionally? Yes
8421,It is approximately the size of a carrot
8422,Touchdown: Vertical Velocity (m/s): Lateral Velocity (m/s): Tilt (deg): Lateral position: m from target center
8423,Falcon boost stage on droneship Just Read the Instructions
8424,"A midnight amendment, followed by a vigorously opposed subpoena. Someone has been naughty"
8425,I played those games
8426,"That's a SpaceX engineer in there, not me"
8427,New Model X SUV now faster than a $500k Lamborghini
8428,"Yeah. It's kinda disgusting, but my boys and I love it"
8429,First picture of SpaceX spacesuit. More in days to follow. Worth noting that this actually works
8430,"I would say that is the greatest publication in the history of all conscious beings, living or dead"
8431,"I'm not the CEO of Ball Mason Jars. Also, not judging"
8432,Was at a friend's party this weekend and drank wine from a mason jar
8433,I can't hide the truth any more
8434,Yes
8435,Watching eclipse with sunglasses on through the Model S glass roof. Wow!
8436,SpaceX rocket factory as seen from space
8437,"Yeah, but not a priority right now"
8438,I'm not coming for anything. Just digging some tunnels and might draw a vacuum on some of them.
8439,"We are going to move all info and settings to the ""cloud"" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you"
8440,Pics of SpaceX spacesuit developed for NASA commercial crew program coming out next week. Undergoing ocean landing mobility/safety tests.
8441,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
8442,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
8443,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
8444,Will prob do something like that
8445,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
8446,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
8447,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
8448,Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.
8449,I love Kermit
8450,"But you can check it out on . Btw, this isn't a video, like cliff diving or fake rocket landings, that matters if it's reversed."
8451,Wigs me out too much. Deleting ...
8452,"Yes, just that the permitting process is slow"
8453,I want one too!
8454,"Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!"
8455,"The danger is def high for South Korea, due to proximity, but much less for distant targets like the US. SK anti-missile tech is excellent."
8456,"We certainly could, but, while not suggesting complacency, I'm confident that the US DoD and intelligence orgs have this covered"
8457,th mission of our Dragon robotic space freighter in support of the

8459,For sure
8460,Biggest impediment to recognizing AI danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't
8461,Would like to express our appreciation to Microsoft for use of their Azure cloud computing platform. This required massive processing power.
8462,OpenAI + Dota
8463,It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
8464,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."
8465,"I sure hope so, but we can't take that for granted"
8466,"If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea."
8467,OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess &amp; Go.
8468,Coming soon ...
8469,Hi Mom!
8470,A level orc illusionist and dressmaker
8471,This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least seconds checking your facts.
8472,Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
8473,There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter &amp; maybe to that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
8474,"One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either."
8475,"MB was given weeks of salary &amp; stock in appreciation for her great contribution &amp; left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist"
8476,"Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist"
8477,"Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
8478,"Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors &amp; never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so"
8479,Major increases in the Supercharger and Tesla urban charger network happening over the next several months
8480,First draft animation of the Falcon Heavy three core launch. FH is twice the thrust of the next
8481,I agree. Working on it ...
8482,It's only a matter of time
8483,y
8484,"True, although the changemyview subreddit is least likely to be clicked on by people who really should change their view"
8485,"Arguments, followed, of course, by complaints"
8486,Are you complaining that we are not complaining enough?
8487,And let's not forget the forum on which we are posting I've heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on Twitter.
8488,Like I said ...
8489,It gets really dark
8490,"True, there are frequent complaint expansion packs"
8491,Except for complaining. That has remained constant throughout history at /100.
8492,Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed km on a single charge! Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!
8493,I guess a proof of concept is needed
8494,Looking forward to launching astronauts to the International Space Station next year!
8495,Sorry about that. You certainly should have been. Will get you guys in a car right away.
8496,"No, must brake safely to a halt"

8502,"There are several dozen ship names in the Culture series, but I liked those best"
8503,Umm ...
8504,"Yeah, it's better than a Model . We can put a lot more in a car at a higher price."
8505,"I'm sure there are better answers than what I do, which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing"
8506,"If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell ..."
8507,"Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for."
8508,Yeah
8509,"The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two."
8510,Model uses two intersecting planes of air for vertical control &amp; lateral fins hidden within the dashboard for horizontal control

8512,Yes
8513,Probably middle of next year. Focus now is on getting out of Model production hell. More versions = deeper in hell.
8514,Yes
8515,Sure
8516,"Watched them personally to make sure &amp; I agree with the outcome. Wouldn't have judged differently. Amazing videos all, but was best."

8531,"Tim's piece on AI is excellent, but we actually face a double exponential rate of improvement. AI hardware &amp; software are both exponential."
8532,I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.
8533,A book of the most beautiful classic cars given to me on my th birthday on a farm in Saskatchewan. Van Gogh's Starry Night.
8534,$US price in $AUD plus import duties and sales tax
8535,We can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public co. Will check if possible through a feeder fund though.
8536,Often comes as a surprise when people learn that % of my time is on engineering/design and just % on other stuff
8537,A m diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories ...
8538,"Yes, I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket &amp; spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day."
8539,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.
8540,Kinda have to
8541,LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries &amp; motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
8542,"Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state &amp; city discussions."
8543,Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
8544,"An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
8545,City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
8546,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
8547,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
8548,For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
8549,Support would be much appreciated!
8550,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
8551,Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in mins.
8552,"Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship"
8553,y
8554,"True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels &amp; confused shorts."
8555,Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
8556,Not true. Email from customer.
8557,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past &amp; present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly"
8558,"Yeah, otherwise hard to find them"
8559,y
8560,"It is true, so fine by me"
8561,"Small thing (very small), but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same."
8562,It's what you don't say
8563,I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
8564,Good point
8565,Fixed. Now it's good.
8566,Yes
8567,Stay tuned
8568,I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow
8569,"Excited to announce the launch of ! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
8570,Just checked and yes
8571,"True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon . Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
8572,Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.
8573,US Senate hearing on advancing the exploration and settlement of space
8574,"We do that too, but for free"
8575,Hopefully
8576,"Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes, buying single use airplanes wd seem crazy."
8577,That doesn't sound right
8578,"Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed (""Other US"" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not."
8579,Latest S and X tires have internal acoustic foam
8580,Going over the small nuances of Model production. Very important that nothing sounds tinny.
8581,Cool!
8582,"The very near future, not, like, the far away future"
8583,"You can now drive anywhere in the US (except N Alaska), most of Europe, China &amp; Japan using the Tesla Supercharger network!"
8584,Of course!
8585,"On University Ave, above the old bakery"
8586,"One of my sons is named Xavier, after Professor X!"
8587,That's probably the best use
8588,Cool
8589,Maybe the upcoming IAC in Adelaide
8590,"It was a tough negotiation, but they seemed like good guys. I hope they kept the stock. Would be worth a lot today."
8591,"That pizza looked about as appetizing as drywall. If anything, they were doing people at the party a favor by taking it."
8592,"Wasn't wearing a suit, am def not part of a ""posse"" &amp; didn't even know Leo/Orlando were going. Just went to say hi to my friend Ken Howery."
8593,"Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back ! No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me."
8594,First Production Model
8595,"It's who is first to pay full price for the car. Hard rule. I have first Roadster and X, but not first S."
8596,"Ira Ehrenpreis had rights to st car as he was st to place a full deposit, but gave those rights to me as my th bday present. Tks Ira!"
8597,Production unit of Model is now built and going through final checkout. Pics soon.
8598,Never heard of them
8599,Stop biting my finger dammit
8600,This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of . Australia rocks!!
8601,"The world's population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care"
8602,"Thanks ! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was km, Falcon achieved km."
8603,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
8604,We're going to spend the th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than th/6th. Only one chance to get it right
8605,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
8606,Looks like we can reach Model cars per month in Dec
8607,"Handover party for first customer Model 's on the th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be cars and Sept above ."
8608,Model passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
8609,Norway is awesome
8610,"Actually, China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things, that's where iPhones, many Android phones &amp; most laptops are made."
8611,Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good
8612,Coming later today
8613,Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed &amp; built it.
8614,Suggestions welcome!
8615,I think Einstein said that
8616,Or does the Earth move up?
8617,This is a really great floor
8618,Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.
8619,Across the road and below the ground
8620,Perspective
8621,"Nothing to be done, but wait. It's all right here:"
8622,News on Sunday
8623,Because it's off the wall
8624,Maybe it is time for the man cape to return
8625,Didn't read it. Might now though.
8626,Exactly
8627,Me too
8628,"Yes, but arguably that's worse"
8629,And I don't care who knows it. Our love will never die.
8630,Just try one. It's way better than you think.
8631,A floor that moves
8632,A ceiling is simply a floor from below
8633,Not as much as tunnels though
8634,They are so underappreciated
8635,They will never let you down
8636,I love floors
8637,Gary (the snail) is a speed demon. Long way to go before we beat him/her.
8638,"Thanks, but I am"
8639,No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
8640,"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long."
8641,"Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack &amp; peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach reentry is X Mach . Intense."
8642,They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
8643,Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it
8644,More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
8645,"Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours."
8646,Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
8647,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
8648,Still humans
8649,Significantly improves control force
8650,Launch at :25 delivering satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.
8651,"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry."
8652,"We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about years ago"
8653,"Not only that, it has all the wifis and G is coming soon"
8654,Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
8655,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
8656,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon to land in heavier winds."
8657,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
8658,"Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"
8659,Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.
8660,Sticking to
8661,"It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace"
8662,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
8663,Falcon will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
8664,"Technically, Ironyman"
8665,Thanks! Looks cool.
8666,"Damn, I forgot bacon"
8667,"In life, there are no easy choices"
8668,Do want irony on social media?
8669,Must remember that irony and social media are not friends. Keep forgetting. Dammit.
8670,Radiation
8671,Groan
8672,"But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise"
8673,Will extend
8674,Over km should be possible in a D with the right tires
8675,Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts &amp; radiative view factor is low.
8676,"No plans to change kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model pack is about cost reduction, not performance."
8677,No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer
8678,Cool
8679,"That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention"
8680,"First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot"
8681,Calling this cueless would be generous. Much less energy required for lithium-ion batteries &amp; Gigafactory is powered by renewables anyway.
8682,No plans to change cell form factor for X and S
8683,"This is crazy, but Max Smart mentions Chaos towards the end. Coincidence?"
8684,There's a plot!?
8685,ujelly?
8686,"My real phone is an HTC Droid, which I ordered after seeing this ad"
8687,Nothing beats the shoe phone that is also a real shoe
8688,But then I get paid less
8689,"Backup valve shows no sign of leaking, but yeah"
8690,If schedule holds there will be two Falcon launches within hours (Cape &amp; Vandenberg) this weekend
8691,"Postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic valve. It is dual redundant, but not worth taking a chance."
8692,"Promising conversations with regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes &amp; pedestrians. Permits harder than technology."
8693,It's time they knew
8694,Tesla service rescues a kitten stuck in the bumper
8695,So soon you won't believe it
8696,Colonizing Mars (thanks Prof Hubbard for creating this from my talk). Major changes to the plan coming soon.
8697,"Hawthorne, California"
8698,Flying through the Falcon Factory
8699,"Mars V2 plan coming soon, which I think addresses the most fundamental flaw in V1: how to pay for development &amp; operation of giant rockets"
8700,Radar-only braking on HW1 is getting better with every release. We're hoping to do the demo where it brakes for a UFO in the fog soon.
8701,"$300M cost diff between SpaceX and Boeing/Lockheed exceeds avg value of satellite, so flying with SpaceX means satellite is basically free"
8702,In discussions with the government of India requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory is built
8703,US govt testing by finds Model X to be the safest SUV in history by significant margin
8704,"That would an interesting target. Would, of course, only count if capable of doing so right off the production line with street legal tires."
8705,How'd you know?
8706,"Linux kernel update was way harder than anticipated. Giant improvement, but meant way more OS overhead tuning to keep screen frame rate good"
8707,"New kernel goes out next weekend, new web browser next month. Radar-only braking is getting steadily better for both HW and ."
8708,HW2 Autopilot release should go wide next weekend with additional smoothness improvements to longitudinal control
8709,"We are developing the interplanetary rocket and spaceship to allow anyone to travel to the moon, Mars &amp; beyond, regardless of nationality"
8710,Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
8711,Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
8712,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
8713,"I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama Prob worth doing?"
8714,Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only % of parts ended up being common.
8715,"Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."
8716,"The faster, the better. Gravity losses."
8717,Damn Stonecutters!
8718,"Was no ""company"", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize ACP's Tzero car. No tech or IP, no employees &amp; didn't even own Tesla Motors name."
8719,"Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation."
8720,Exactly
8721,Congrats Robb!
8722,So crazy that people were arrested for trying to keep their cars from being destroyed
8723,You may have Heard of the person who put it together
8724,"Worth watching ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" By . Truth is indeed stranger than fiction"
8725,"If Zedd is kind enough to send me a list, it's on"
8726,"All Superchargers are being converted to solar/battery power. Over time, almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid."
8727,"I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV adoption! Great example for the rest of the world."
8728,"Long way to go, but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs &amp; gave them all our patents to help, so that's something"
8729,"Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought % prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance."
8730,"Since big car companies were killing their EV programs, the only chance was to create an EV company, even tho it was almost certain to fail"
8731,"They was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars"
8732,Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in &amp; then crushed them in a junkyard
8733,That is true. Ludicrous mode is like having pure joy on tap. Nothing else (legal) will get you that.
8734,Click the left scroll wheel to pause or mute music
8735,"Good point, will add ""cancel nav"" to voice commands"
8736,Too awesome
8737,Must ipso facto half not bee
8738,"First of all, I cracked a long time ago. That's not news. Second, yes, I can see time. How did you know?"
8739,"Yeah, car should auto play when it gets an exact match, like it does for directions. Will make that change."
8740,Just confirmed the Tesla DJ station works in Canada
8741,Cool
8742,"No, it's not!"
8743,Yes
8744,Tap cancel on the screen
8745,"Just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say ""Play Monty Python"" or ""Navigate home"" or anything. Voice commands work pretty well."
8746,"Just depends on whether you like a sedan or SUV. Sedan goes faster, SUV has more room."
8747,"Yeah, coming back"
8748,Coming soon!
8749,Partly
8750,Possibly my favorite skit
8751,Might work in Canada too
8752,I mean also
8753,Not yet
8754,Yeah
8755,"In the US, you can ask your Tesla to play any Monty Python (or other comedy) skit. Doesn't work outside US yet."
8756,"It's on the car. Might add it to the Tesla app at some point, so you get it on your phone if you have a Powerwall or Tesla solar."
8757,My favorite for sure
8758,Try the new Tesla DJ station on streaming radio
8759,The scene where Brian is saved from the Romans by falling off a tower into a spaceship is the best Deus Ex Machina moment of any movie ever
8760,"All Falcon Heavy cores should be at the Cape in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after that"
8761,Love Monty Python so much
8762,"Just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of me. That hurts, ok?"
8763,Yeah
8764,Yeah
8765,These guys want us to die so bad they can taste it
8766,Could be worse
8767,"We can either give up hope &amp; sit in traffic hell forever or try something new. The odds of success may be low, but they're better than zero."
8768,The Boring Company is in Hawthorne and has already approved the permit
8769,Thanks Such an outrageous lawsuit. People sometimes underestimate strength of US judiciary. Lot of respect for the judge &amp; jury system.
8770,Read
8771,Almost. Falcon Heavy was way harder to develop than it seemed at first.
8772,"Once you add the vintage record player, it's all good"
8773,You're welcome!
8774,"A little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien ... and magic!"
8775,A step facial treatment every morning. The mistake people make is stopping at .
8776,"And um ... not trying to brag or anything, but I think I look good for"
8777,Seems that way
8778,Of course. What base-number system were you using?
8779,That's why the pic is in black and white. Didn't have color back then.
8780,"Yeah, I counted"
8781,Tesla shareholder meeting today. Can't believe it's been years since we went public.
8782,"This is a metaphor for transparency. Also, f* underwear."
8783,Obviously
8784,"SEC disclosures, etc"
8785,"I'm not *saying* they're related, but"
8786,Or is it more about the way you use it?
8787,I hope I'm wrong
8788,"Probably closer to to imo. would be a linear extrapolation, but progress is exponential."
8789,Great comedy! They should write for .
8790,Most likely
8791,"Also, we will have a very high headcount around each Gigafactory keeping it running. They just won't be doing boring, repetitive tasks."
8792,Probably closer to four or five factories. Logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end customer.
8793,California Cabernet
8794,Wearing anything at all is just a conspiracy by the capitalist running dogs of Big Underwear
8795,He was great though
8796,Was just at the DMV &amp; dude had the actual sloth from Zootopia on his desk
8797,"Most people don't realize you can see Dragon approach the Space Station from the ground, even in LA"
8798,Proud of my Mom
8799,"Yeah, pretty much dead center. We painted the target area with radio reflective paint, which helps the radar be more precise."
8800,Exactly
8801,It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars &amp; airplanes and how it should be for rockets.
8802,First reflight of a Dragon spacecraft set for later today
8803,Good point
8804,India commits to sell only electric cars by . It is already the largest market for solar power.
8805,"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by as the US does from all sources today"
8806,Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
8807,Coming soon
8808,Yeah
8809,Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case
8810,"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp; via councils, that we remain"
8811,And then some
8812,"Yeah, it was great!"
8813,Piggyback rides around the Opera House
8814,Sydney is such a beautiful city
8815,A lot
8816,"I do via my foundation, which is now years old, but my grants are (almost always) anonymous"
8817,Yes
8818,Should finish trans-Canada this year. A stop in Swift Current for sure!
8819,Yes
8820,Comparing Model S vs Model
8821,Old-school fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks
8822,There will be a combined booster static fire. Maybe a few.
8823,"Btw, that cloud is almost entirely steam, including dark parts (like a storm). This is what the launch looks like:"
8824,"Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ..."
8825,Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to people.
8826,Only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain
8827,You are right. Going at max speed. Not much time left.
8828,Busted
8829,Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.
8830,True
8831,Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me
8832,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
8833,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
8834,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
8835,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
8836,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
8837,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety"
8838,Exactly
8839,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
8840,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
8841,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
8842,Hopefully June for those too
8843,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
8844,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version ). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a ."
8845,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that % of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
8846,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
8847,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
8848,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
8849,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
8850,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off"
8851,Something cool for sure
8852,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
8853,"Model , Model X &amp; Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision &amp; control software."
8854,Wear underpants
8855,Will do
8856,Black and textured slate versions will be
8857,Yes
8858,"For reason I can't explain, I find especially odd. Also, not a fan of . Has led too many people astray in valuing securities."
8859,"Still agree with Tim's points. What ""you"" are is an evolving, mind-body pattern, but there's still a core youness that holds true over time."
8860,"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle &amp; practical limits of simultaneity in transfer make this exact thought experiment impossible, but yeah"
8861,We got stuck
8862,All the answers to questions you never asked about holes in the ground
8863,What pun?
8864,What I love about The Boring Company are the low expectations. Nowhere to go but down.
8865,T-boned in a Model X at mph
8866,Moonlight Sonata
8867,Robots that learn by example from
8868,"It's sort of like a pickaxe if you use the claw side, but has the added advantage of also hammering"
8869,"Gary the snail is like Speedy Gonzales on meth ... or ambien. One of the two. Either way, Godot, our tunnel machine, is still a distant nd."
8870,And ... it's done
8871,Worked in Minecraft. Just sayin ...
8872,Of course. Why is that even a question?
8873,Imma gonna dig that tunnel with this here hammer
8874,My grandmother was from Moose Jaw
8875,Going to a barn raising!
8876,"On my cousin's farm in Canada at , wearing a hat on a hat"
8877,"Yeah, worked on the farm when I was"
8878,"Family history article. Was born in South Africa, but named after my American great-grandfather."
8879,Yes
8880,"[Warning, this may cause motion sickness or seizures] This is a test run of our electric sled"
8881,"The race between Gary, our pet snail who lives in a pineapple, and Godot, our tunnel boring"
8882,Boring machine segments have been lowered into the starter tunnel. Going through final assembly.
8883,Cutterhead in operation at standard industry speed. Planning to jack this up by a factor of ten
8884,First tunnel for The Boring Company begins ... Full length of first tunnel will run from LAX to
8885,"Entry hole, staging area and starting tunnel for Boring Machine (aka Godot) now complete"
8886,"Tesla needs to iterate fast on solar roof prefab/install technology, so all installs will be done by Tesla techs at first"
8887,Third one will be from Frost. Maybe the second.
8888,Yes. Good.
8889,"First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where."
8890,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems &amp; plays. Decided against plays &amp; poems. Too obvious.
8891,That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
8892,This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.
8893,Slo-mo hail cannonball impacting Tesla solar roof tile
8894,"Will do our best. Hopefully, yes."
8895,Yes
8896,Solar roof can be ordered for almost any country. Deployment this year in the US and overseas next year.
8897,Black glass smooth and textured will be first. Tuscan and French Slate in about six months.
8898,U.K. delivery and installation next year
8899,Yes
8900,Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about hours ...
8901,"If heat death of the universe is the destination, it really is all about the journey"
8902,It's a good one
8903,Thanks for doing it!
8904,Headed to see Guardians w my bro and kids. Loved the first one.
8905,"I do love Banks, but perhaps we should reserve his names for the droneships"
8906,Simple. I like it.
8907,Kinda like Snoop Dug
8908,I don't want to be presumptuous
8909,"I know what you're thinking then why not ""the Third""? Well, I've learned my lesson about 's."
8910,"By calling it ""the Second"", it has more credibility"
8911,"Maybe Ultimate Boring Machine, the Second"
8912,Boring Not Boring
8913,Good one
8914,Been done
8915,Thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine
8916,Was just rereading one of my favorites. So beautiful
8917,"Close-up of rocket stage separation, fast flip, boostback burn in a ring of fire and then"
8918,Landing
8919,"Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good. Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at % of the theoretical load limit."
8920,"Winds aloft are unusually high (still within structural safety bounds). Worrying, but not a showstopper."
8921,"Yeah, will probably publish an update in six weeks or so"
8922,My boring TED talk
8923,Couldn't agree more
8924,Extremely
8925,Even more boring
8926,Boring
8927,"We def want to avoid either, particularly Surface Detail ..."
8928,On it now
8929,"Great food, great ambience and with great friends. We all really enjoyed the visit."
8930,Will definitely do that on my next trip
8931,"Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard, and"
8932,That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
8933,"Yeah, sorry I missed that. This would only work for kWh packs that are software created to , so not ."
8934,Yes
8935,Tesla will soon be offering a compelling means of upgrading a to a
8936,July
8937,Pickup truck unveil in to months
8938,Next gen Roadster will be convertible
8939,Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
8940,Yeah
8941,"Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it."
8942,This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...
8943,Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest
8944,"Fairing is ~$5M, but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to %."
8945,Latency should only be min max. Checking ...
8946,Feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered Tesla Easter eggs
8947,And so the robots spared humanity ...
8948,"Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows."
8949,"Et tu, Walt?"
8950,Stormy weather in Shortville ...
8951,Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It's basically dead.
8952,It's just a helicopter in helicopter's clothing
8953,It won't matter
8954,Pretty good
8955,"Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you, aliens! So obtuse! You have all this crazy tech, but can't speak English!?"
8956,Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
8957,"Def P100D with Ludicrous+, although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that"
8958,We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
8959,Working on it
8960,Looks like it could do % more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
8961,A lot
8962,Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend &amp; Monty Python.
8963,"Good point, odds go from % to &gt;0%"
8964,Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
8965,"Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot."
8966,Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
8967,Thanks Phil!
8968,Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within hours.
8969,"If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times"
8970,"On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance."
8971,Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model .
8972,Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
8973,No
8974,You won't care
8975,What gave me away?
8976,No
8977,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...
8978,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
8979,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
8980,Yes
8981,Yes
8982,I believe so
8983,Yup
8984,Oh so little faith
8985,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a kWh pack in Model at current cell/module energy densities
8986,Yeah
8987,Start taking orders in April
8988,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
8989,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles"
8990,The Model S produced today is arguably version . Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model arrives.
8991,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
8992,No problem
8993,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
8994,Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
8995,"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in to months."
8996,Damn straight we do! Coming with next week.
8997,First drive of a release candidate version of Model
8998,It still has one display
8999,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
9000,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
9001,How about the video we just took of the first Model release candidate drive?
9002,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
9003,I think so
9004,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
9005,Tues/Wed
9006,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
9007,Tues/Wed next week
9008,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
9009,"Yes, but not until next year"
9010,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
9011,"Sorta. Model is like a BMW series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW and series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
9012,How about now?
9013,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
9014,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
9015,Definitely
9016,"Model was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different"
9017,Yes
9018,"Model is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
9019,"Am noticing that many people think Model is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone vs . This is not true."
9020,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
9021,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
9022,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
9023,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
9024,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
9025,I hope that didn't work
9026,~spawn npc.alien
9027,Where are the %*&gt; aliens?
9028,Looks like Tues/Wed for release
9029,Except that isn't actually my house ...
9030,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
9031,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
9032,"is a great car, but definitely Model S"
9033,Good point
9034,I wish. It's so annoying.
9035,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ..."
9036,Ok
9037,"It's been a bear to get done, but prob days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
9038,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
9039,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
9040,". Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
9041,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially"
9042,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
9043,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
9044,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at
9045,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC."
9046,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.
9047,"Just spoke with , Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
9048,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
9049,$250/kWh at the pack level for MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
9050,Tesla will get the system installed and working days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
9051,Will send you one
9052,Self-hatred
9053,Thanks JJ!
9054,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!
9055,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.
9056,"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it or times ever."
9057,Fly me to the moon ... Ok
9058,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at pm PST
9059,of course
9060,maybe one of those too
9061,Roller coasters are awesome
9062,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
9063,Good chance it will
9064,Exactly
9065,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
9066,Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
9067,Excellent Tesla Model X review
9068,Just posted a video
9069,Baby came back
9070,no
9071,System was green for launch. I called it off.
9072,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp risk on Dragon , that I feel very confident of ."
9073,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
9074,"Btw, % likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that % chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
9075,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
9076,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
9077,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
9078,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast
9079,spacex's photo
9080,"Provided Dragon demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in"
9081,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
9082,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow."
9083,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
9084,It's much easier to do the CGI that way
9085,Daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.
9086,I used that one
9087,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
9088,They are doing India proud
9089,You may come to regret that request
9090,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
9091,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
9092,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
9093,"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
9094,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
9095,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited."
9096,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
9097,Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
9098,Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
9099,Falcon rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex -A. This is the same launch
9100,Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
9101,"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
9102,of course it will
9103,Should all be uploaded by next month
9104,Motor Trend could only achieve sec when they tested the Porsche
9105,I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
9106,George Schultz and Jim Baker article in regarding a carbon tax
9107,yes
9108,Hoping for summer this year
9109,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
9110,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit ."
9111,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
9112,"No plans to take X, S (or ) above kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
9113,Take out the floor mats and its . MT said everything had to be standard production.
9114,yes
9115,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to mph in sec
9116,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
9117,No rare earth metals in battery
9118,Almost ready
9119,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
9120,"Yes, but Model is the overwhelming priority"
9121,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
9122,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
9123,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
9124,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in chars and tone is lost in text"
9125,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
9126,Rolling out a new update today.
9127,We should try our best
9128,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
9129,I just had three coffees
9130,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
9131,Numeric
9132,Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
9133,"I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota."
9134,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
9135,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
9136,True. Me being one of them
9137,"Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but th out of + countries with only a diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
9138,"Fair point, sorry"
9139,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
9140,Exactly
9141,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
9142,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
9143,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
9144,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool"
9145,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
9146,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
9147,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
9148,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
9149,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
9150,Mostly anti-drug laws
9151,Exactly
9152,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
9153,The remedy for that is changing the law
9154,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
9155,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
9156,True!
9157,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
9158,Walking down the street and saw this
9159,I wish!
9160,"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
9161,"Wow, cool!"
9162,That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
9163,Nuances are important
9164,ft diameter tunnel running miles under D.C.
9165,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
9166,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
9167,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council &amp; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
9168,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"
9169,First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
9170,maybe
9171,Video of MIT's entrant into the SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Air has been removed from the Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.
9172,Minecraft
9173,"Yes. Green cards &amp; dual citizens already ok. Work &amp; spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action."
9174,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
9175,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
9176,yes
9177,Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
9178,"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
9179,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI
9180,"I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting"
9181,"Yeah, sorry about that"
9182,"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"
9183,Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material
9184,Strategic &amp; Policy Forum
9185,"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
9186,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus &amp; present to President.
9187,It is not
9188,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong &amp; don't deserve to be rejected."
9189,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the countrys challenges
9190,"This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true."
9191,And we start digging the tunnel tonight
9192,Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
9193,"Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people &amp; it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution &amp; hope good comes of it."
9194,"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway."
9195,"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the Freeway, which is mins from LAX"
9196,Yup
9197,Maybe next month
9198,Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.
9199,Rex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle.
9200,I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
9201,No they don't
9202,Was wondering what those were
9203,Sigh
9204,That may be a difficult award to decline
9205,"Tillerson also said that the risk of climate change does exist and he believed action should be taken"""
9206,"... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."""
9207,"Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: ""I think its important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ..."
9208,"Ok, fine. Soldier . My dark secret is out ..."
9209,I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
9210,"Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA."
9211,"This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State."
9212,There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
9213,"months maybe, months definitely"
9214,"Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present"
9215,"Auto steer limited to mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data."
9216,Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every to weeks
9217,For now
9218,"The D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted"
9219,Yes. Block is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
9220,"If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically"
9221,Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every to months.
9222,Yes
9223,"Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing + parts. Wish there was an easy way."
9224,Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China!
9225,Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon .
9226,"Car won't complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically, so camera more robust to pitch angle."
9227,Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
9228,Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
9229,"Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory"
9230,Our target is a % reduction with HW2 as the software matures

9602,Our radar is using a wavelength of mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
9603,especially well
9604,Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
9605,"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
9606,yes
9607,certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
9608,effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
9609,elevation too
9610,only just gained access to physical vehicle
9611,AP process crash would show up in logs
9612,"Working on using existing Tesla radar by itself (decoupled from camera) w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point cloud, like lidar"
9613,"Maybe didn't realize he turned it off, but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument cluster."
9614,exactly
9615,"Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on."
9616,EU regulators find no safety concerns with Autopilot
9617,It's all fun &amp; games until ...
9618,We don't mind taking the heat for customer safety. It is the right thing to do. From
9619,can't wait to see the costume
9620,Only if I can play a monkey
9621,"Tesla finishes last in being salesy! Good. Also, I can't believe there is a real Pied Piper."
9622,Something like that
9623,already taken care of
9624,Kinda. Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery &amp; solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason
9625,I like your tweets!
9626,"Tricky in chars, but: B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that."
9627,Blog on Autopilot by
9628,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
9629,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before B.
9630,"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
9631,"With less than B miles, there simply isn't enough data. B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
9632,"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
9633,exactly
9634,"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
9635,why?
9636,thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
9637,Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
9638,"you're right, no point"
9639,"Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."
9640,"Misunderstanding of what ""beta"" means to Tesla for Autopilot: any system w less than B miles of real world driving"
9641,Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
9642,"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part . Hoping to publish later this week."
9643,"Story was fed to LAT &amp; many other media to counter IMF $5T/year fossil subsidy study. Hey, both have a !"
9644,seriously
9645,Love reddit. Gandel gets shredded &amp; won't even answer top upvoted questions. Some really funny comments about Koch
9646,"Model S had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA, which is why ..."
9647,thanks
9648,"true, good point"
9649,"No, you were misleading mostly on your own, but w many copycats. Jalopnik just lost it's sense of irony &amp; didn't get my tweet."
9650,"cool, thanks"
9651,The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
9652,"In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert."
9653,"Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert."
9654,"All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include."
9655,Tesla response to the misleading Fortune articles about Autopilot
9656,Sponsored articles
9657,Because of course I hate flamingos...(maybe try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your salad)
9658,Exactly! I love Twitter.
9659,Wrong to exclude non-occupant deaths. Autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed
9660,"If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about M+/year deaths from other auto companies?"
9661,"Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market."
9662,Radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
9663,Our condolences for the tragic loss
9664,Shakespeare. Then love-devouring death do what he dare; It is enough I may but call her mine.
9665,aspirationally
9666,"My son recently asked what my favorite animal was. Well, of course"
9667,Thoughtful analysis of the Tesla/SolarCity merger by
9668,Thanks for the kind bday wishes!
9669,cute!
9670,exactly
9671,We haven't signed anything for a factory in China
9672,"Deluded, deranged, etc. Journalistic thesaurus sure got a lot of use last week ..."
9673,"Article is misleading to readers. No one is ""taking home"" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table."
9674,Of course. Our love will never die.
9675,This is going to be great
9676,Drive units and battery are sealed
9677,"If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential"
9678,"We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation."
9679,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side
9680,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. is the year of experimentation."
9681,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
9682,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
9683,Thanks Tyler
9684,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
9685,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
9686,Quite rapid... Yes
9687,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly
9688,Looks like thrust was low on of landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
9689,"Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship"
9690,Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll
9691,"Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will."
9692,"Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely."
9693,No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
9694,Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
9695,"That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics"
9696,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
9697,Latest science predicts &gt; trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens
9698,"Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious."
9699,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
9700,"Of greater concern: of suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
9701,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
9702,That is correct. It was about innovation.
9703,Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on
9704,no
9705,Something about a flying metal suit...
9706,yes
9707,S and X cells are also Panasonic
9708,Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
9709,Fourth rocket arrives in the hangar. Aiming for first reflight in Sept/Oct.
9710,"PC, of course"
9711,Highly recommend by the good people of if you like ultrafast team FPS action
9712,Trippy
9713,I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
9714,Exactly
9715,Good article from explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to Tesla funding
9716,how did you know?
9717,Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
9718,exactly
9719,It is simulations all the way down
9720,"At this point, I'm really running out of crazy things to say. Any suggestions?"
9721,control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
9722,Just heard that Norway will ban new sales of fuel cars in . What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!!
9723,"Yay, baby made it home!"
9724,autosteering chutes will be added soon
9725,Recode interview with and via
9726,Supercharger policy explained well by : Will post detailed description soon. I think it's a good balance.
9727,Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by
9728,Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this &amp; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
9729,So it was good for you too ...
9730,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
9731,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
9732,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
9733,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
9734,Satellite deployed to km apogee. All looks good.
9735,mins to launch
9736,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
9737,Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
9738,"Flight is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
9739,Great image of ancient Mars
9740,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
9741,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
9742,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
9743,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
9744,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
9745,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
9746,Full height of Falcon boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
9747,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon , but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
9748,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
9749,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
9750,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
9751,yes
9752,yup
9753,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
9754,Three's company
9755,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
9756,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.
9757,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
9758,tambin te amo
9759,It's probably the Ambien
9760,Definitely
9761,Ok
9762,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
9763,coming soon
9764,Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
9765,I think so
9766,Max is just X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
9767,I love you too!
9768,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to km above Earth"
9769,Thank goodness all are ok
9770,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
9771,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
9772,Woohoo!!
9773,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
9774,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model soon if you want delivery"
9775,yes
9776,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
9777,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
9778,"Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
9779,Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
9780,next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
9781,exactly
9782,"sides def, center maybe"
9783,naturally
9784,Falcon Heavy thrust will be M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
9785,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to M lbf later this year. It is capable of M lbf in flight.
9786,F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be kg
9787,"No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
9788,No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
9789,Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract % to % for reusable booster payload.
9790,"Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce sigma reserve margin."
9791,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon and Heavy
9792,yes
9793,turns out it doesn't need securing
9794,yes
9795,"yes, several times"
9796,for sure
9797,things like this should be purged shortly
9798,+ for almost everything + for heat shields and a few other items.
9799,Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
9800,"JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
9801,System scan detected only % of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
9802,of course
9803,Temporary spike in some areas due to X rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
9804,"Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are , so speculation unlikely."
9805,Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
9806,checking into it ...
9807,will definitely do so
9808,"some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
9809,"It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
9810,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
9811,Dragon is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
9812,"A should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
9813,That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
9814,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well
9815,"Aiming for relaunch in to months, pending detailed examination and X refiring of a returned booster"
9816,We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
9817,By land and sea
9818,Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.
9819,Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck
9820,Godot Full play
9821,"Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where."
9822,me too!
9823,Great video history of Falcon by Kinematic
9824,needs latest update
9825,"Activate autopilot X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon."
9826,"Not from us, but it's awesome"
9827,"Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not"
9828,Thanks
9829,yes
9830,"Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think."
9831,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you."
9832,Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
9833,Thanks!
9834,Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
9835,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
9836,"Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none."
9837,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet
9838,Nickel is also in nickels
9839,"Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic."
9840,"Over k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only % ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation."
9841,the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
9842,"yes, will go all the way to Alaska"
9843,"Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter."
9844,we will
9845,Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
9846,We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
9847,Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche Turbo S to a Model X
9848,Model X review
9849,probably unwise
9850,"won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height"
9851,yes
9852,yes
9853,yes
9854,yes
9855,sounds good
9856,"Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells."
9857,Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
9858,"yes, coming this year"
9859,Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
9860,you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for .
9861,correct
9862,hopefully
9863,what's the link to that?
9864,"No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
9865,no problem
9866,Will cover whole country hopefully this year
9867,"yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
9868,less
9869,torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
9870,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
9871,"Model will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
9872,yes
9873,Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
9874,definitely
9875,should be addressed this year
9876,Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
9877,that's not the real steering system
9878,yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
9879,Some tweaking underway
9880,Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the . It feels like a spaceship.
9881,Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
9882,Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
9883,They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
9884,It will make sense after part of the Model unveil
9885,"A Model order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
9886,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
9887,We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
9888,There will be an optional tow hitch.
9889,Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
9890,Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
9891,"cool, thanks!"
9892,"Yes, if the trend continues, before"
9893,k Model orders by end of Sat
9894,Model design sketches
9895,"We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before production starts."
9896,They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
9897,"Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for . They deserve a lot of credit."
9898,"we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
9899,"yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
9900,and a few other things
9901,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe -30 people per store would line up, not . Gifts on order."
9902,Maybe /4 to /2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part of the unveil.
9903,"Will give an update tonight for the day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."
9904,k as of am this morning
9905,thanks!
9906,Now k orders
9907,of course
9908,"Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night."
9909,def on the cards for the future
9910,should be within a week or two max
9911,"Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car."
9912,Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
9913,"Thought it would slow way down today, but Model order count is now at k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly."
9914,"Model orders at in hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!"
9915,Will include India-wide Supercharger network
9916,sure!
9917,Coming in the mail
9918,Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
9919,Just order the SpaceX option package!
9920,"Thanks for tuning in to the Model unveil Part ! Part is super next level, but that's for later"
9921,"yes, will cover whole country"
9922,yes
9923,sure is
9924,X and S will also be available
9925,"Adding several more countries to Model order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland."
9926,"Model orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person"
9927,Online ordering at will now open at :30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at :30.
9928,From almost anywhere
9929,Coming soon!
9930,"Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model . You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up."
9931,Model unveil will be webcast live at :30pm California time at
9932,"You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve."
9933,"Tomorrow is Part of the Model unveil. Part , which takes things to another level, will be closer to production."
9934,Model order day starting in Australia
9935,You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing.
9936,Great article by . Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most
9937,Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model
9938,Tesla charger map
9939,being fixed
9940,sure
9941,"Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window."
9942,no
9943,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
9944,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was years away from achieving this.
9945,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
9946,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
9947,Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
9948,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
9949,Target altitude of km achieved. Thanks for riding on Falcon ! Looking forward to future missions.
9950,We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
9951,. SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
9952,Evolution hasn't advanced much
9953,MIT Technology Review
9954,checking ...
9955,exactly
9956,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
9957,Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
9958,Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
9959,AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
9960,"Great leg room for rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
9961,"yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
9962,"Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick seats unless you really need ."

10000,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
10001,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
10002,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
10003,steel collet
10004,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
10005,probably
10006,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
10007,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
10008,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
10009,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine showed thrust fluctuations."

10025,Background on the launch
10026,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
10027,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
10028,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
10029,Meant to reply to this article:
10030,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
10031,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
10032,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
10033,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
10034,About mins from static fire
10035,holding for issue resolution
10036,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
10037,mins from static fire test
10038,"yes, from F to F"
10039,It worked in Texas
10040,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
10041,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
10042,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
10043,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
10044,Announcing formation of
10045,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
10046,Agreed. Working on it.
10047,wow
10048,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
10049,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
10050,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
10051,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
10052,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
10053,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
10054,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
10055,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
10056,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
10057,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
10058,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
10059,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
10060,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
10061,Yeah and hell yeah
10062,From anywhere
10063,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
10064,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
10065,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
10066,definitely aliens!

10075,Cool!
10076,"Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
10077,"Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term."
10078,"Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
10079,Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
10080,We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
10081,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
10082,Model is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
10083,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
10084,"important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
10085,Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
10086,"Autopilot coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
10087,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
10088,all
10089,Hoping for Friday release

10684,"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
10685,"Even if the answer is only on the order of %, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
10686,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
10687,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
10688,Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round
10689,"Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety"

11300,Its good
11301,That was a crazy tough year. Tesla financing closed at pm Christmas Eve last hour of the last day possible. Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas.

11324,This assumes completion of the b sales
11325,"Pure vision, especially when using explicit photon count, is much better than radar+vision, as the latter has too much ambiguity when radar &amp; vision disagree, it is not clear which one to believe"
11326,A strong bias towards consumption tax makes sense
11327,People who dont create products &amp; services dont realize that it takes hard work to produce products &amp; services
11328,"Agreed. Taxes do need to be collected, but what is the best way to do this that maximizes area under the curve of the happiness of the people?"
11329,A lot of improvement still coming just from software updates to satellites &amp; terminals
11330,I talked about Falcon &amp; Heavy for over a decade!

11365,Tesla FSD plus holiday fun software release probably Tuesday
11366,The ship is just begging for three more vacuum engines to be added. Tanks will stretch for more propellant load.
11367,degrees
11368,"Yup. Next booster will have Raptor engines, with steering. Ship is being upgraded to engines (3 sea-level gimbaling, vacuum fixed) with increased propellant load."
11369,Each Raptor engine above produces metric tons of force. Raptor just started production &amp; will do + tons or over half a million pounds of force.
11370,Starship Super Heavy engine steering test
11371,Interesting
11372,The great state of Massachusetts deserves someone better
11373,"This is such a deeply messed up lie to the American people. She is the one freeloading off taxpayers, while Im paying the largest amount of tax of any individual in history. Is really someone we want as a US senator?"
11374,"Still much to be done, but it has that potential"
11375,This is a big deal
11376,It might be
11377,"Wow, this video took a lot of work!"
11378,Trondheim sounds cool
11379,"I saw it. Whoa, pretty dark! Nice Bladerunner reference."

11390,"I came to the US with no money &amp; graduated with over $100k in debt, despite scholarships &amp; working jobs while at school"
11391,"Its complicated, but hopefully out next quarter, along with Witcher. Lot of internal debate as to whether we should be putting effort towards generalized gaming emulation vs making individual games work well."
11392,Yeah!
11393,I love Dilbert! Use it all the time to illustrate that were doing something wrong at Tesla/SpaceX if it could be a Dilbert cartoon irl. This happens more often than Id like (sigh).
11394,That is weird
11395,Highly recommend all of
11396,Thanks!
11397,Congrats

11451,They have no idea
11452,Um yes
11453,Should arguably be called
11454,next week is great
11455,That is not the production wiper
11456,Lasers can do anything
11457,There will be a few tweaks before production
11458,I do aspire to entertain the people!
11459,Imbued gold/bronze color would be sick
11460,"Manufacturers have to ship cars with side mirrors by law, but owners are allowed to modify their cars. The wiper is what troubles me most. No easy solution. Deployable wiper that stows in front trunk would be ideal, but complex."
11461,"Not at first, but there are many third party options for wrapping"

11481,There is a lot of accounting trickery in this bill that isnt being disclosed to the public
11482,"If temporary provisions in the Build Back Better Act become permanent, US national debt will increase by %!"
11483,Judith Cohen (Jack Blacks mother) also did important work on Apollo
11484,Brain transplants
11485,Booster production is currently ahead of engine production

11488,Wow
11489,"Hopefully, this month, no later than next"
11490,Progress
11491,Its true
11492,Replacing faulty/missing neurons with circuits is the right way to think about it. Many problems can be solved just bridging signals between existing neurons. Progress will accelerate when we have devices in humans (hard to have nuanced conversations with monkeys) next year.
11493,"There are already minimum age requirements for the House, Senate &amp; Presidency. Reciprocally, there should be maximum age limits too."
11494,"I am definitely not saying that we can for sure do this, but I am increasingly confident that it is possible"

11506,He is quite a bossy dog
11507,NFTs are jpeging the dollar
11508,Landing on tower arms
11509,My car is currently orbiting Mars
11510,You betcha
11511,Starships to Mars
11512,We will soon make these real
11513,Haha pretty much
11514,Exactly
11515,It is an honor to serve NASA and the countries of the International Space Station
11516,"A is hallowed spaceflight ground no place more deserving of a Starship launch pad! Will have similar, but improved, ground systems &amp; tower to Starbase."
11517,Huge cranes are cool haha
11518,This will look so awesome!
11519,I love Norway!
11520,Yes
11521,"It releases internally today, then rolls out to external beta in a few days if no significant issues are found"
11522,But yes
11523,Product roadmap update on next earnings call
11524,Yes
11525,"Will have both front &amp; rear wheel steer, so not just like a tank it can drive diagonally like a crab"
11526,Insane technology bandwagon
11527,"Initial production will be motor variant, with independent, ultra fast response torque control of each wheel"

11539,Exactly
11540,Doesnt even need maintenance just works!
11541,"The sun is absurdly, overwhelmingly the source of energy in our solar system"
11542,"No, but you could get pretty far with rings of separately orbiting objects, like our solar systems asteroid belt"
11543,"And the sun is technically green, as measured by peak photon count"
11544,But lower power density than a human

11551,Yes
11552,"If a severe global recession were to dry up capital availability / liquidity while SpaceX was losing billions on Starlink &amp; Starship, then bankruptcy, while still unlikely, is not impossible. GM &amp; Chrysler went BK last recession. Only the paranoid survive. Grove"
11553,The overarching problem is that we need better mental firewalls for the information constantly coming at us. Critical &amp; first principles thinking should be a required course in middle school. Who wrote the software running in your head? Are you sure you actually want it there?
11554,Its getting fixed
11555,Suits will need to be made in high volume at an affordable cost &amp; be much easier to use
11556,"We had to shift some Starlink satellite orbits to reduce probability of collision. Not great, but not terrible either. Station &amp; Dragon have micrometeorite shields (ultra high velocity impact absorption), but EVA suits do not, hence higher risk for spacewalk."
11557,"years later, games are photo-realistic D worlds. What does that trend continuing imply about our reality?"
11558,I love a great whine
11559,Splish splash
11560,Just dropping some friends off at the pool
11561,Humanity shall return!!
11562,"Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare &amp; its not over! I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call."
11563,Cybertruck will reach far into a post-apocalyptic future &amp; bring that technology to now
11564,Cybertruck is intentionally an insane technology bandwagon
11565,Variable gain (steer by wire) yoke would be ideal
11566,"Acid test for new interface is use it for weeks &amp; see if you still want old version. After using yoke for few weeks, I didnt want wheel."
11567,Yoke allows unobstructed view of the screen
11568,A lot has happened in years
11569,USA benefits greatly from Indian talent!
11570,"It will still be very intense, just slightly less than in the past"
11571,"This is true. Also, Tesla employees get health insurance, stock &amp; other benefits."
11572,Nice
11573,The most ironic outcome is the most likely
11574,Yeah
11575,"Hypothetically, if they did make lots of electric cars, then they would be the leader"
11576,Exactly
11577,Good thread
11578,Figuratively &amp; literally
11579,Yup
11580,"We learned our lesson with $465M DoE loan received in /2011 onerous terms exceed value of money received. Thats why we paid it back so early, despite an early repayment penalty."
11581,Must be nice living in Cloud Cuckoo Land
11582,Maybe drive an upright Falcon past the White House flying a giant Stars &amp; Stripes with a marching band playing I can see clearly now?
11583,Thats our initial interstage design that we scrapped
11584,"Combined Tesla+SpaceX market cap is now over $1.2T, which means $4.9B is less than % of combined company value"
11585,"It has always been Teslas view that all subsidies should be eliminated, but that must include the massive subsidies for oil &amp; gas. For some reason, governments dont want to do that"
11586,"Great speech, couldnt agree more!"
11587,"Great, hope yours is too!"
11588,Haha true
11589,Absolutely!
11590,Happy Thanksgiving to all! Hope you have a great day. Your support over the years is super appreciated
11591,Seriously!!??
11592,Avenge the dinosaurs!!
11593,Why watch it happen instead of helping making it happen?
11594,Sorry it took so long
11595,Jay rocks!
11596,Yes
11597,Same
11598,Such miracles are beyond us
11599,"If we are able to make life self-sustaining on Mars, we will have passed one of the greatest filters. That then sets us up to become interstellar. Earth is ~4.5B years old, but life is still not multiplanetary and it is extremely uncertain how much time is left to become so."
11600,"Earth has been and will be smashed super hard by meteors over time. Not a question of if, just when."
11601,"In , comet Shoemaker-Levy smashed a hole in Jupiter the size of Earth"
11602,"This will be really important one day. Much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on Earth, but there were far more that merely destroyed a continent. Comets (not asteroids) are the real wild card, as were only able to track ~4600 out of ~1 trillion."
11603,About to launch asteroid defense test!
11604,That is the great question
11605,Exactly
11606,Exactly (sigh)
11607,Sounds good
11608,"It can simulate anywhere, but we need to focus on one region until FSD is out of beta, then expand geographically to have betas in other countries. Canada is not a lot different from US, but different enough."
11609,"High-performance code is in C using our own compiler to maximize frame rate. We use Python with custom libraries for fast prototyping, then convert to C for fast execution. New software is run against real-world video &amp; our world simulator to evaluate performance, then QA."
11610,"I dont use Binance (tried at one point, but signup was too many hoops to jump through), so no inconvenience to me personally. Just raising this issue on behalf of other Doge holders."
11611,Our NNs didnt have any temporal &amp; spatial memory or surround video auto-labeling back then everything was knitted together in C++ from single frames with manual labeling. Still much to improve.
11612,Doge holders using Binance should be protected from errors that are not their fault
11613,Wisdom
11614,"Hey , whats going on with your Doge customers? Sounds shady."
11615,I was able to do several zero takeover drives around Austin last night using random map pin drops (no Tesla has ever done these routes)
11616,Yes
11617,"Hell of a rocket! Probably would have succeeded if Korolev had not died. Hopefully, Starship is more fortunate."
11618,"And all Model S &amp; X production for the world is still done in America, but whos counting"
11619,Giga Texas is epic
11620,Ancient times
11621,True
11622,And I will talk to their manager!
11623,The sheer physicality of changes in the brain during sleep or with serious neurodegenerative diseases is much higher than people realize
11624,We do need to have the Fallout-themed party! Aiming to do that once international travel restrictions are lifted.
11625,"Meant to say county (sigh). Airport will be part of it, but required additional federal approvals."
11626,Transforming America!
11627,"Its either traffic forever or tunnels. Try our first operational tunnel in Vegas at the convention center! The city just approved a full tunnel network, connecting major hotels, convention center &amp; airport."
11628,Interesting eyes too
11629,"Long-term, ship would land on tower arms, like booster"
11630,Unlikely for early ships to splashdown intact. Getting to orbit at all on first try would be a major win.
11631,Serious allegations deserve serious responses
11632,Probably around March
11633,It gives me solace
11634,At least % of my tweets were made on a porcelain throne
11635,Model S Plaid is sickkkk!!!!
11636,I aspire to comedy
11637,Lets see if we can get them to say the word Tesla!
11638,King of the who!?
11639,Maybe they are NPCs and Tesla just isnt in their dialogue tree?
11640,Or perhaps some cheese
11641,Its like if you want to buy a parrot
11642,The IRS already has dedicated audit teams for high net worth individuals. The doubling of staff is for everyone else.
11643,"I bounce around WSJ, NYT, BBC, Bloomberg, WaPo &amp; twitter generally. Better to follow individual journalists than publications, as there is a wide range of quality."
11644,I like the new direction CNN is going tho
11645,Interesting
11646,"We are on the wrong planet for SSTO. On Mars, it is thankfully easy."
11647,"If Earths gravity was even % lower, Id be all for single stage to orbit"
11648,Yup
11649,"Unfortunately, there is just no way to make a motorcycle safe. Motorcyclist deaths per mile are ~29 times higher than car occupants."
11650,Much has changed
11651,Congrats! Orbit is not easy.
11652,Bitcoin cures cancer
11653,I love these shots
11654,Electrical &amp; mechanical engineering
11655,What my fathers work looked like when I was growing up
11656,"One of the improvements to FSD vision involves training with actual photon counts, so removing the filters used to make pictures pretty to the human eye"
11657,"Should be coming back online now. Looks like we may have accidentally increased verbosity of network traffic. Apologies, we will take measures to ensure this doesnt happen again."
11658,"A simpler time, it was"
11659,Checking
11660,Hopefully tomorrow
11661,Fractured but whole
11662,". Keith, is this about right?"
11663,"Tragically, it is not clear that the defense contractors can get to the moon for any amount of money. More than $200B has been spent on development of new US crewed space transport systems over past ~40 years, but only Dragon is flying. Development cost to NASA was &lt;$2B."
11664,Its good to be open about ur vulnerabilities
11665,This launch mount is not easy to build
11666,I suspect that article was written before the drive even took place
11667,Dont want to brag but Im the best at humility
11668,"There were no EV incentives (nor did we expect them) &amp; gasoline was super cheap, so tough to make the case for electric cars. My guess was that we had &lt;10% chance of success &amp; most people thought %. The history car startups is just one big graveyard."
11669,Thats what I was thinking too!
11670,If only he could find those chaos emeralds
11671,Is he ever not grumpy!?
11672,So fast and yet so slow
11673,Yes
11674,True
11675,"Its great that theyve changed their tune these days, but the truth is that GM tried damn hard to kill the electric car! If not for competitive pressure from Tesla, they would be doing nothing."
11676,Exactly
11677,Indeed
11678,Sigh
11679,Propublica should be bottom left
11680,Grover Gardner rocks
11681,Is this real?
11682,It is hard to find good sources of relatively objective news these days. Any suggestions?
11683,We are choked with news and starved of history Durant
11684,My comments starts at :49 mark
11685,Talked about Starship with National Academies Space Studies Board
11686,It does need people!
11687,"Accept worst case outcome &amp; assign it a probability, which is usually very low. Now think of good things in life &amp; assign them probabilities many are certain! Bringing anxiety/fear to the conscious mind saps it of limbic emotional strength. Cheery fatalism is very effective."
11688,"Limiting factor for first launch is regulatory approval. Thereafter, fundamental issue is solving engine production. Prototypes are easy, production is hard."
11689,"True, although it will look clean with close out panels installed. Raptor has significant improvements in every way, but a complete design overhaul is necessary for the engine that can actually make life multiplanetary. It wont be called Raptor."
11690,million pounds of thrust at liftoff
11691,"Indeed. Over time, Tesla will generate hundreds of billions for the government in terms of employee income tax, product sales tax and property tax, in addition to profit taxation."
11692,Accurate thread
11693,We are waiting for permit approval from Santa Monica
11694,I like to dig my grave real deep
11695,Exactly
11696,Burry is a broken clock
11697,"The hard work by FAA, US Fish &amp; Wildlife and Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife is much appreciated, as well as the strong local support from Cameron County and Brownsville / South Padre!"
11698,"Normal money is actually a bunch of ancient mainframes running cobol in batch mode, where govt can edit money database whenever they want"
11699,Exactly
11700,"Yes, that is the other major source of dilution. All employees receive stock after a year at Tesla and we now have over employees worldwide."
11701,That loophole does seem questionable
11702,"I had majority control for the first years or so of Tesla, but car companies need lots of capital, so now Im around % or so, despite putting in as much as I could along the way"
11703,"Agreed, taxes are best applied to (especially extravagant) consumption, whereas capital allocation taxes reduce goods &amp; services output, so actually bad for the people. Probable capital allocation skill of heirs is lower than original creator, so I am in favor of an estate tax."
11704,"Regretamine, its like a % tax on all your regrets!"
11705,His stance on ketamine was bold
11706,How do we know he hasnt been kidnapped by aliens!?
11707,"Ok, how much do you think is fair? Does % seem reasonable?"
11708,"Inflation is the most regressive tax of all, yet is advocated by those who claim to be progressive"
11709,Due to inflation has gone up by
11710,"Bernie is a taker, not a maker"
11711,Exactly
11712,"Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word"
11713,"Soon, that list will grow much longer as humanity reaches new heights!"
11714,I keep forgetting that youre still alive
11715,"A careful observer would note that my (low basis) share sale rate significantly exceeds my b (high basis) option exercise rate, thus closer to tax maximization than minimization."
11716,How about predictions for ?
11717,Super proud of the great work by the SpaceX team!
11718,"Please dont read too much into this. As mentioned publicly, Tesla is constrained by chip supply short-term &amp; cell supply long-term. Not possible to produce additional vehicles in volume until both constraints are addressed."
11719,"Ive actually been living in a ~$50k house in south Texas for past years, not Boxabl (cool product tho). Feels more homey to live in a small house."
11720,"Megapacks are deployed to stabilize the grid itself, especially effective for absorbing peak loads. They save consumers money."
11721,Such a beautiful day to launch
11722,The rocket fleet grows
11723,Best plane ever
11724,Tesla Megapack batteries will help stabilize the grid this winter
11725,Orbital Flights
11726,"Should work everywhere for global maritime by roughly middle of next year (enough sats with laser links launched). Until then, it will be patchy when far from land."
11727,"Inter-satellite laser communications means Starlink can carry data at speed of light in vacuum all around Earth before touching ground. Over time, some amount of communication can simply be from one user terminal to another without touching the Internet."
11728,Exactly
11729,It is a very impressive history
11730,"Once the board was presented with the evidence of Eberhards deception/fraud &amp; the dire state of the company, all board members, including those he appointed, voted unanimously to fire him in August ."
11731,Thinking of doing a podcast Hardcore History style that tells what really happened at Tesla in those early years
11732,"He came damn close to killing Tesla through a combination of bad management decisions, driving out talented people, bad engineering, major blunders in supply chain &amp; an elaborate deception about the true cost &amp; schedule of the Tesla Roadster."
11733,"Founding story of Tesla as portrayed by Eberhard is patently false. I wish I had never met him. Eberhard is by far the worst person Ive ever worked with in my entire career. Given how many people Ive worked with over the years, thats really saying something"
11734,Good static fire with all six engines!
11735,"No guarantees, but maybe next month. Requires quite a lot of incremental testing &amp; code tweaks for different road system in Canada."
11736,Hoping to start releasing to scores with V10.5 in about days
11737,Ancient times
11738,"I hope theyre able to achieve high production &amp; breakeven cash flow. That is the true test. There have been hundreds of automotive startups, both electric &amp; combustion, but Tesla is only American carmaker to reach high volume production &amp; positive cash flow in past years."
11739,Pattern on the Starlink router is orbital transfer ellipse from Earth to Mars
11740,New UAW slogan: Fighting for their right to steal money from workers!
11741,"Interestingly, however, average power density of the sun is comparable to a compost heap (humans are more power dense than the sun) it is just very, very big"
11742,"There are many other good causes, but this is my main reason for accumulating capital. The resources I consume personally are very low."
11743,"As described in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (great book), a linear accelerator would be great for the moon. Earths gravity is too high &amp; atmosphere too dense for accelerators to be a good solution vs reusable boosters imo."
11744,Still blows my mind that this is real
11745,And that is a very tiny fraction of the ~4 megatons of mass that the sun converts to energy every second
11746,Sometimes theyre a little -dimensional
11747,I have all their albums
11748,(Zero is a cool concept)
11749,Nothing matters
11750,lifetimes ago
11751,Dragon enters like a shooting star
11752,Really just comes down to iron cathode for medium range vehicles &amp; stationary storage vs nickel cathode for long range vehicles
11753,Important
11754,The Starship fleet is designed to achieve over times more payload to orbit than all other rockets on Earth combined. Almost no one understands this.
11755,True
11756,"Actually, tons for SpaceX in Q3 &amp; aiming for tons in Q4. That said, China launch mass to orbit is extremely impressive."
11757,Coming soon
11758,. ahem
11759,Why does ur pp look like u just came?
11760,I had too many bottles of Teslaquila!
11761,Exactly
11762,I was prepared to accept either outcome
11763,Doing the opposite of whatever that insufferable numbskull says would be a great way to invest!
11764,"We are rolling out slowly, as there are many subtle hardware differences in the owner fleet. If it continues to look good over the next few days, we may start rolling out to safety scores."
11765,Will consider
11766,Tesla Autopilot spends a lot of effort on minimizing jerk
11767,Roll them
11768,* abide(n)
11769,"Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock."
11770,"I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes"
11771,Wrath of the Khans
11772,"Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling % of my Tesla stock. Do you support this?"
11773,I say this frequently
11774,"Haha true! The top alternate name, if we couldnt acquire the Tesla Motors trademark, was Faraday, which a competitor ended up using."
11775,"Some late-breaking issues with . Were deploying a patch to internal beta vehicles around am tomorrow. If that goes well, we may be able to release to external beta vehicles on Sunday. Many good improvements."
11776,Seems that way. Publishing their transaction ledger would clarify matters.
11777,We will post finer-grained details of software improvements going forward
11778,Exactly. Improved memory will cause predictions to converge &amp; reduce jitter.
11779,Hype^Hype
11780,"In the future, any Tesla you use will automatically sync to your preferences"
11781,Probable
11782,Neural net upgrades coming that improve persistence across time &amp; space (better object permanence)
11783,Cool
11784,Not yet. They should just post their transaction ledger. Must be somewhere.
11785,And Mars
11786,Haha true
11787,So are tunnels
11788,"Yup, even the moon"
11789,How about my lil doge Floki? He would make a great CEO! His judgment is .
11790,What they are doing is just not right
11791,sigh
11792,Me!
11793,"Youre welcome! If any of this is based on Hertz, Id like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet. Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers. Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics."
11794,Humankind
11795,Almost finished Jngers Storm of Steel. Intense. Great book.
11796,"Its simulations all the way down, until eventually its just bit"
11797,"- Everything on the Internet is true! - Externalize responsibility! - If you are able to do this, buy crypto!"
11798,Absolutely
11799,He talks like an NPC with a limited dialogue tree
11800,Srsly
11801,He looks good even for a -year-old!
11802,Both of those factories failed &amp; shut down long ago. Strange thing to brag about.
11803,Literally cant tell if this is real or deep fake
11804,Should be a term limit for these appointees
11805,Trial program for opening Tesla Superchargers to other EVs has begun
11806,Thanks!
11807,Sanjay deserves a lot of credit for making X/PayPal succeed. Now helping SpaceX serve rural communities in India. Much respect.
11808,"Yup, nd UAW president in a row. Unlikely to be the last."
11809,What happened here?
11810,Biden is a UAW puppet
11811,Please publish your current &amp; proposed spending in detail so people can see exactly where money goes. Sunlight is a wonderful thing.
11812,"By definition, since I own ~20% of Tesla, ~80% of stock gains necessarily went to investors &amp; employees!"
11813,"Austin should be its city, not a San Francisco copycat"
11814,Tuition is in Dogecoin &amp; u get a discount if u have a dog
11815,"But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent."
11816,"If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it."
11817,Pretty close
11818,"Indeed. The factory was empty at the time, stripped of all equipment that wasnt worth even its scrap value. But we salvaged what was left &amp; fixed up the old machines so some could work again."
11819,What gave it away!?
11820,Thanks on behalf of Tesla
11821,"Unfortunately, yes"
11822,A culture of corruption his words
11823,"Nope, T is def first"
11824,Tesla Hertz Shorts
11825,Universally admired
11826,Obv
11827,That would rock
11828,It will have epic merch
11829,Am thinking of starting new university: Texas Institute of Technology &amp; Science
11830,We are so fluffy compared to a neutron star

11833,Tesla always pays its debts
11834,Cover story for Godzilla obv
11835,"Tax experts said they're not sure if claiming unrealized donations is legal, but admitted it's all very confusing, as the government is printing fake money and taxing nonexistent profits and nothing is real anymore."
11836,Thanks for your support over the year !
11837,The cemetery of automotive startups over the past century is very large &amp; will get larger. Tesla &amp; Ford are the only American car companies that havent gone bankrupt.
11838,"Indeed, US taxpayers actually profited from the Tesla loan"
11839,"GM &amp; Chrysler were bailed out (money never repaid), but Tesla was not. Crucial Tesla investment actually came from Daimler in , from which they did very well. Tesla received govt energy efficiency loan in , by which time capital markets reopened. Loan was repaid early."
11840,My plan is to use the money to get humanity to Mars and preserve the light of consciousness
11841,"US Federal Debt/GDP was % in , now it is % &amp; climbing fast"
11842,"US national debt is ~$28,900 billion or ~$229k per taxpayer. Even taxing all billionaires at % would only make a small dent in that number, so obviously the rest must come from the general public. This is basic math. Spending is the real problem."
11843,You can also talk through the car speaker. Great for practical jokes
11844,"Tentative plan is &amp; above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week. If we see any concerns, uploads will pause while we investigate, so might take a few days before everyone with safety gets beta . improves left turns across fast traffic &amp; stopping for gates."
11845,"FSD/AI team is doing great work. Will get superhuman good in upcoming releases. Note, we will slow down upload rate of releases going forward. First from QA fleet to employee cars for a day, then slowly releasing at ~1000 cars/hr to external beta on Friday aft."
11846,"That math is incorrect, but still a lot of devices per second! I guess if Tesla can reach M cars/year, that would be one every ~1.5 seconds!"
11847,"According to their own estimates, this tax only covers ~10% of the $3.5 trillion spending bill. Where will the other % come from? The answer is you."
11848,"If I send you Doge, will you promise to send me Doge?"
11849,"Wow, years ago"
11850,I feel like this has happened at Tesla a few times
11851,I kinda like avocado toast &amp; pro level coffee tbh Starbase cuisine does an amazing job with those.
11852,Another way of saying were in a simulation
11853,"Reducing traffic fatalities by % seems likely, perhaps ultimately by over %"
11854,This is more important than it may seem at first
11855,"Also, Tesla will soon be a German car manufacturer."
11856,"German car manufacturers will rebound strongly. They possess great talent, which will not sit idle."
11857,But the Bee nails it again
11858,Who is best at capital allocation government or entrepreneurs is indeed what it comes down to. The tricksters will conflate capital allocation with consumption.
11859,Thanks
11860,Truth is stranger than fiction
11861,"To be clear, cars sold to Hertz have no discount. Same price as to consumers."
11862,"I dont know about long-term, but short-term we are seeing strong inflationary pressure"
11863,"Exactly. Eventually, they run out of other peoples money and then they come for you."
11864,Id like to express appreciation to Tesla Autopilot engineering &amp; QA for working round the clock all weekend to resolve the problem
11865,"Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD. Our internal QA fleet didnt see this, because cars are constantly in use, so very rarely enter power saving mode. Internal QA will obv test this case going forward."
11866,"Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem"
11867,Wild $T1mes!
11868,"Indeed, this is intended to be useful advice, based on my extremely painful experience, not an attack in any way"
11869,"Prototypes are trivial compared to scaling production &amp; supply chain. If those are solved, achieving positive gross margin is the next nightmare. Starting a second new vehicle line before first is working will divide resources &amp; amplify probability of failure."
11870,That feature is coming
11871,rolling out now

11880,Pop music has both literal &amp; figurative Stockholm Syndrome
11881,Wasnt easy
11882,Lots of people I talked to on the production lines at Tesla or building rockets at SpaceX own Doge. They arent financial experts or Silicon Valley technologists. Thats why I decided to support Doge it felt like the peoples crypto.
11883,"Seeing some issues with , so rolling back to temporarily. Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta."
11884,"Out of curiosity, I acquired some ascii hash strings called Bitcoin, Ethereum &amp; Doge. Thats it. As Ive said before, dont bet the farm on crypto! True value is building products &amp; providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form."
11885,None
11886,"Possibly. Bitcoin was conceived at a time of relatively low bandwidth &amp; high latency. If both continue to improve substantially, we will reach a point when no second layer is needed."
11887,Were working on this issue right now
11888,"Not recently. What matters imo is lowering fees, decreasing block time &amp; increasing block size. A single layer network with exchanges as de facto layer seems like the simplest solution for a medium of exchange."
11889,As requested
11890,"Got to bar before RUD, but cause may be due to oxygen inlet pressure too low, rather than engine issues"
11891,We live in a gerontocracy
11892,Plus crypto scams haha
11893,"Neither Jared, nor me, nor anyone I know has anything to do with this foundation"
11894,Your support makes a big difference! Please let the FAA know your opinion.
11895,Yes
11896,"Regression in some left turns at traffic lights found by internal QA in . Fix in work, probably releasing tomorrow."
11897,Come see the Apple Cloth
11898,*In Dogecoin
11899,Squid Game is Squid Game for ISPs
11900,Hey QT314
11901,Starbase under construction
11902,Great!
11903,I mean just the image
11904,Can I retweet this in cropped form?
11905,"If all goes well, Starship will be ready for its first orbital launch attempt next month, pending regulatory approval"
11906,Tries to launch some rockets accidentally summons dark lord
11907,Its gonna be great!
11908,Interesting
11909,Exactly
11910,Shaking out the problems (literally) haha
11911,"Yeah, although early production cars will need camera upgrades, as well as FSD computer (all included in the price)"
11912,"No, we expect some tiles to shake loose during static fires"
11913,Hopefully
11914,"Currently at ~270 bar, but working on upgrades to get it over bar"
11915,"Raptor has a very high chamber pressure, which in turn allows for a large expansion ratio nozzle without flow separation at sea level"
11916,This will be cool
11917,Beat the !
11918,We are
11919,Noooo
11920,Very soon
11921,"Yeah, when were out of beta"
11922,Most likely
11923,Absolutely
11924,"Well-said, Dr Aldrin!"
11925,Yup
11926,Well-optimized Starship would do ~250 tons to orbit as expendable &amp; ~150 tons fully reusable
11927,Nods
11928,The day FSD goes to wide release will be one of the biggest asset value increases in history
11929,Full &amp; rapid reusability is the holy grail of orbital rocketry
11930,Most big companies in tech have turned into places where talent goes to die
11931,"Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla"
11932,cgi irl
11933,Odd
11934,"Theyre required by law, but designed to be easy to remove by owners"
11935,Ovaltine is amazing!
11936,"I would gladly obey the chemtrails, but I dont understand what they are saying haha!"
11937,Luck is the best superpower
11938,Good review
11939,"As soon as major construction is done, so maybe in a few months"
11940,Ive thought about and Im not sorry for party rocking
11941,Autonomy must &amp; will work even with no connectivity
11942,"We can do that partially, but detailed rocket technology is considered advanced weaponry (same tech as nuclear missiles), so there are more limitations than at Tesla"
11943,Yeah
11944,Maybe Buffett should invest in Tesla haha
11945,"Thanks Cameron County, Brownsville &amp; South Padre for your support! Much appreciated."
11946,Thanks!!
11947,Hopefully enough to extend life to Mars
11948,"We already have a giant, free fusion reactor in the sky called the sun. Just catch its energy with PV, store in battery &amp; youre pretty much done."
11949,Correct
11950,Technical details will be in release notes
11951,Beta releasing Friday next week to all cars with /100 safety score
11952,Pretty much
11953,Fan art is the best
11954,LASIK has improved so many peoples lives!
11955,Great game
11956,Haha
11957,"Congrats, was cool to send to space"
11958,If it possible to start an EV company without shipping any cars &amp; get a valuation less than a billion dollars!?
11959,"I hope they have a high pain tolerance. Scaling production, supply chain, logistics &amp; service is a world of hurt."
11960,"Yes, we are talking to airlines about installing Starlink. Please let them know if you want it on your airliner. Low latency ~half gigabit connectivity in the air!"
11961,These are strange days
11962,They will
11963,Many great suggestions in this thread!
11964,"Death Note, Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Full Metal Alchemist, Your Name"
11965,Cant wait to be in Genshin Impact
11966,Hoping to get this done soon
11967,Aspirationally for everyone
11968,Godspeed Captain
11969,Lasers
11970,Maybe next week. Wed like to get to before expanding the beta.
11971,Always
11972,"Agreed. Trying to get all the approvals needed to offer insurance is extremely difficult, but its coming."
11973,"Production, supply chain &amp; logistics are so hard!"
11974,Yeah
11975,"But they should go electric now. Less range, but so easy, quiet &amp; clean."
11976,There is something great about the Cessna /182 design
11977,"Yeah, on its way (sigh)"
11978,Starship Launch Site
11979,"Beenz, Beenz the musical fruit the more you eat the more you toot"
11980,All the stairwells currently shown as wood-clad will actually have graffiti
11981,Starship is a hard problem
11982,Not to mention warm-up latency
11983,"Vision became so good that radar actually reduced SNR, so radar was turned off. Humans drive with eyes &amp; biological neural nets, so makes sense that cameras &amp; silicon neural nets are only way to achieve generalized solution to self-driving."
11984,"Just want to emphasize this is the work of hundreds of awesome engineers in both software &amp; hardware, over data analysts &amp; billions of owner miles"
11985,"Low occlusion gates are challenging, but should be fixed soon"
11986,Beta now rolling out to cars with /100 safety score over miles
11987,It will be available in perforated rolls
11988,"[puff, puff] what if the cure for cancer [puff, puff] was in the leaf ??"
11989,Its coming
11990,Thanks for playing Giga Berlin!
11991,"I love ALW! Couldnt agree more. My dog Marvin is Havanese too, although Im *his* emotional support human."
11992,Team is in fact working hard! They just confirmed is good to go tomorrow night.
11993,Its true
11994,Hell yeah
11995,Sure hope so!
11996,Physics ftw
11997,"These are nice, but high time we built a really big Tesla coil!"
11998,"Cells &amp; FSD are massive, the rest is just beauty &amp; romance but life is empty without those last two"
11999,"Yeah, headlights are precision LED, so they can be bright without blinding oncoming traffic, pedestrians &amp; cyclists"
12000,"It will hopefully achieve sustained cycle time of seconds. At % uptime over an average week, thats ~10k/week if run /7."
12001,Sunday/Monday
12002,Das klingt nach Space Party
12003,A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.
12004,Giga Berlin-Brandenburg Spa-Party heute!
12005,There are many small joys as you explore the car &amp; more to come via software updates
12006,So crazy to have come this far!
12007,Exactly
12008,"If youd like to join Tesla AI, but cant easily move to Palo Alto or Austin, that is acceptable for extremely excellent candidates where inefficiency of distance is overcome by talent"
12009,Sorry if weve been too dumb to respond to you. Please cite evidence of exceptional ability in a few bullet points. Nothing else matters.
12010,Please consider joining Tesla AI software or hardware teams!
12011,"Im so dying to do a supersonic, electric VOTL jet, but adding more work will make my"
12012,"Starlink is designed for low to medium population density, which means we can hit max users in some areas fast. Please sign up early to ensure a spot. As more satellites roll out, SpaceX will be able to serve more."
12013,"Should be nationwide rollout by end of month. Note, still limited by peak number of users in same area. This will improve as more satellites are launched."
12014,Haha true
12015,Definitely further refinements coming to (early beta) safety test score. It will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability. Exciting actuarial problem!
12016,Sure
12017,"Its a big deal that Dragon is reusable, with improved refurbishment efficiency with each passing flight! This is not the case for other orbital spacecraft. It means the spacefleet grows every time a new Dragon is made."
12018,"Long list of mostly little items, but driving experience is significantly better. We will put notable changes in the release notes."
12019,Everyone with a perfect score with get it. There are ~1000 owners with perfect scores. Maybe to by Friday night.
12020,"Note, quality of experience can vary dramatically, as our neural nets have far more training data in some parts of the country than others, but this should improve rapidly with more driving in those regions."
12021,Yes
12022,Try explaining it to a -month-old thats hard!
12023,"FSD Beta rolls out Friday midnight to ~1000 owners with perfect /100 safety scores. Rollouts will hold for several days after that to see how it goes. If that looks good, beta will gradually begin rolling out to scores &amp; below."
12024,Tesla always pays its debts
12025,"This was *extremely* difficult. Huge props to Tesla engineering, supply chain, production &amp; key suppliers."
12026,Floki Frunkpuppy
12027,Wow!
12028,"Awesome, effortless ordering is our goal"
12029,Tough choice so many great movies but Spaceballs for me
12030,Lookin good
12031,"Walk this way no, *this* way"
12032,I wish I had had the opportunity to talk to him
12033,Same
12034,"Good point, will discuss with team. Floki pic tomorrow."
12035,New Dune is good
12036,I really wanted to like it
12037,Amazing show about mission!
12038,Manufacturing will be Teslas long-term competitive strength
12039,This is real btw
12040,And thanks very much to our suppliers &amp; logistics partners for coming through despite great difficulties!
12041,Congrats Tesla team!
12042,Will be Falcon size sooner or later
12043,Pushed a week to align with
12044,"With &amp; Powerwall battery you are your own utility. /7 clean, sustainable electricity."
12045,"Hello , great pic! (Thats me waving)"
12046,That is the goal
12047,Proof was good!
12048,AMD has been great to work with!
12049,"No guarantees, but I think it will. This is a big part of what I meant by Teslas long-term competitive advantage being manufacturing technology."
12050,"SpaceX has sued to be *allowed* to compete, BO is suing to stop competition"
12051,Maxwell was incredible
12052,Really?
12053,Hamster has mad skillz!!
12054,This is a serious concern.
12055,We aim to do the most for the least $
12056,"Apologies, release will be a week from Friday"
12057,"First few days probably /100, then , , etc."
12058,"Wow, lot of interest in FSD beta! Plan is to roll out version midnight Friday, then on-ramp ~1000 owners/day, prioritized by safety rating."
12059,"If tiles are not super thin, you get hot plasma waterfalling off edges of tiles, creating hotspots. That said, Im not entirely convinced that this couldnt be done with several overlapping scales of metal sheet with an insulator between scale armor &amp; primary structure."
12060,Headed tank vent knocked off a few tiles
12061,Cybertruck option package
12062,Of course
12063,ISIS
12064,Where is Hitchcock when you need him?
12065,Illustrates why Tesla sales will soon exceed mass of universe
12066,"In an electric future, batteries are as essential to transport as oil is today"
12067,Noted. You should be able to press mic button &amp; say bug report
12068,Ok
12069,"A helpful case to consider, as the roads intersect at unusual angles"
12070,True
12071,Comes in discreet packaging
12072,Well ya see we need to reach around the rocket to uhh
12073,Absolutely! Tesla team rocks
12074,"We use no cobalt at all in most of our cars &amp; tiny amounts in others (going to zero soon), whereas phones &amp; laptops primarily use cobalt"
12075,"And booster used to be m, but this required an awkward half barrel width of steel, so now its m"
12076,Haha so true of rocket engine development
12077,Very much a beta calculation. It will evolve over time to more accurately predict crash probability.
12078,Yes
12079,"FSD Beta request button goes live tonight, but FSD needs another hours of testing, so out tomorrow night"
12080,"Chris was an early employee of SpaceX, and made a significant contribution, but was not a cofounder"
12081,Maybe reality is a Rick &amp; Morty episode
12082,I didnt think so at the time
12083,So pointy!
12084,Super important for Doge fees to drop to make things like buying movie tix viable
12085,Giga Berlin will help a lot
12086,That would break the NASA budget!
12087,"AI used to be , until last year"
12088,Birth rate collapse is the biggest threat to human civilization
12089,We always do flight readiness reviews! This argument makes no sense.
12090,Logistics is underrated
12091,"Exactly. Giga Shanghai makes cars for export in first half of quarter, then cars for far away parts of China, then cars for nearby parts of China. Net result is a crazy wave of deliveries end of quarter. It is tough on our team, so were hoping to reduce the wave in Q4 &amp; Q1."
12092,Great view of Earth!
12093,Tesla is the king of car farts!
12094,"Hopefully worldwide long-term, but insurance is a regulatory labyrinth/escape room!"
12095,"The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow &amp; complex, varying considerably by state. Tesla is hoping to offer real-time (based on actual driving history) insurance in Texas next month. Probably next year before we get approval in New York."
12096,"Good point, we could enable visualization before control. Will enable that option hopefully next month."
12097,should solve that last cone issue
12098,Definitely upgraded toilets We had some challenges with it this flight.
12099,"Not super surprising, given that internal combustion engine cars literally have combustion in the name"
12100,"Yeah, a little oven for heating food &amp; Starlink wifi"
12101,Just met with the crew in Florida to congratulate them in person. Such great people!
12102,Tesla has not yet decided on a fourth Gigafactory location
12103,"To be precise, completely &amp; immediately reusable orbital rockets are the fundamental breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary"
12104,Which games did they like most?
12105,Nice work!
12106,Good
12107,"No, has to be turned on by car owner"
12108,Yes
12109,Tesla insurance calculator will show status in real-time &amp; tell you what actions are needed to be rated good driver
12110,days after approval to log driving style
12111,Not a tiny engine
12112,"Remarkable how few people realize this capability exists. Many think it is years away! With public beta rollout in coming weeks, awareness should improve dramatically."
12113,Seems that way
12114,"Looks fine. Take aspirin, call me in the morning."
12115,Some amount of cooperation would be good
12116,Absolutely
12117,Hes still sleeping
12118,Needs a little warming up
12119,I wish there were more
12120,So few products that you truly love
12121,Count me in for $50M
12122,Congratulations !!!
12123,One of my favorite movies
12124,"Yes No, but it will get refilled &amp; maybe cargo transfer"
12125,"Making life multiplanetary is an extremely hard, but not impossible, problem"
12126,Still basically nothing compared to the orbital mass flux needed for a base on moon or Mars
12127,"Probably will trap a Tesla with the production Autopilot build, but wont work with FSD. Using a ring of cones would stop FSD though."
12128,It will be there
12129,"This engine needs to be X lower cost. Order of magnitude change is good reason for a new name. What really matters is not yet another advanced rocket engine, as there are many such devices, but there has never been a cheap (&lt;$1000/Ton-force) rocket engine. Not even close"
12130,Sigh
12131,"Long chain hydrocarbons, like kerosene, have excellent volumetric energy density, but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen, which is CH4. Also, easy to make &amp; store CH4+O2 from CO2+H2O, which are abundant on Mars."
12132,"Fully reusable rockets want high T/W to minimize $/ton to orbit, because propellant cost actually matters"
12133,Automatically drive to most obvious location unless occupant says otherwise
12134,"With that, Ship is basically begging for an extra engines"
12135,Exactly
12136,Ignition!
12137,Throw in some hydrogen &amp; lithium for a real party
12138,What propellant?
12139,"Moving at ~23 times speed of sound, circling Earth every ~90 minutes"
12140,"Ironically, yes at this time. FSD beta system at times can seem so good that vigilance isnt necessary, but it is. Also, any beta user who isnt super careful will get booted. beta users operating for almost a year with no accidents. Needs to stay that way."
12141,"Yeah. Wed use our Ka parabolics or laser links for Dragon, Starship or other spacecraft as soon as they got above cloud level."
12142,Sorry it was cold! Dragon will have a food warmer &amp; free wifi next time
12143,Jay is right
12144,"Please add your voice to the public comments. Support is greatly appreciated! Humanitys future on the moon, Mars &amp; beyond depends upon it. Thanks, Elon"
12145,"The lesson from tortoise &amp; hare is not that tortoises are faster, but rather that hares should not be complacent"
12146,September will be interesting
12147,"Technology probably ready in a few months, thereafter limited by regulatory approval"
12148,"Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for days, beta access will be granted."
12149,Yes
12150,Next month
12151,Good feedback from FSD Beta users! point release rolling out now. rolls out a week from Friday with beta request button.
12152,Truth is stranger than fiction
12153,Congratulations on a successful mission!
12154,"RIP, Sir Sinclair. I loved that computer."
12155,Just spoke with crew. All is well.
12156,Missions like Inspiration4 help advance spaceflight to enable ultimately anyone to go to orbit &amp; beyond
12157,Thats my safe word too
12158,Maneuverability is important for safety
12159,Thanks Richard!
12160,Thank you
12161,It was an honor to wish you Godspeed before you left for orbit!
12162,Watch Countdown on Netflix about Inspiration4 mission launching today
12163,"It is hard to overstate criticality of reusable rockets. No less important than reusable aircraft, cars or bicycles. Essential for humanity to become a multiplanet species &amp; backup the biosphere."
12164,It has indeed become hard to find which platform has which show
12165,Im not saying there are UFOs but there are UFOs
12166,"Also, we need to figure out how to render voxel height of unknown objects in a way that isnt horrendous"
12167,"FSD predicts height from video pixels directly, without needing to classify groups of pixels into objects. In principle, even if a UFO crashed on the road right in front of you, it would still avoid the debris. Some work still needed to tune sensitivity."
12168,Deep
12169,"Whether its stamp collectors in Andorra or petticoat aficionados in Lichtenstein, none can resist!"
12170,Nice work!
12171,Gravitas
12172,Nicheman (power of appealing to niche audiences) strikes again hahaha
12173,Emojilution
12174,They are not yet friends
12175,Ok ok haha
12176,Will do!
12177,Floki has arrived
12178,(Ahem)
12179,Literally!
12180,Forward flaps will change a lot in upcoming versions of Starship smaller &amp; more leeward
12181,"This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers."
12182,"Falcon is technically a heavy lift rocket. If flown as an expendable, payload to orbit is similar to Delta IV Heavy (~25 tons to LEO). And Starship is ~10 times bigger."
12183,Nice drive
12184,"With , it will creep forward with more confidence &amp; quickly reverse back a little (just as a person would) if it sees danger"
12185,Think of Beta as enabling a significantly higher local maximum than Beta
12186,"To be fair, investors are giving us significant credit for achieving self-driving, given that Teslas valuation/production is very high compared to other automakers"
12187,Three weeks
12188,Digital clock coming in weeks
12189,Please challenge Tim of Apple to trial by combat
12190,Didnt you sorta win?
12191,"Highway stack is still production version, as it is more polished than FSD for now. Single stack for all should release in ."
12192,Yeah
12193,"These are V1.5 Starlinks with laser inter-satellite links, which are needed for high latitudes &amp; mid ocean coverage"
12194,An early season episode of the Tesla soap opera!
12195,"Great work by Tesla team, with special thanks to Tesla Automation in Prm, who were critical to many high-performance parts of Plaid!"
12196,Exactly. Getting paid by the government to launch payloads at much lower prices than competitors is not government support.
12197,Satellites with lasers in space [strokes white cat]
12198,"Alter falter! Dankeschn Nrburgring, Tesla wird geerht."
12199,Booster static fire on orbital launch mount hopefully next week
12200,Metallurgy Rlz
12201,POV Hardcore
12202,"Track software update probably a few weeks away (I know, I know haha). Also waypoints &amp; other things."
12203,"Tesla doesnt have the bandwidth to do it, but there are some good third party mod shops"
12204,"Next will be modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes &amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop)"
12205,"Tesla Model S Plaid just set official world speed record for a production electric car at Nurburgring. Completely unmodified, directly from factory."
12206,"Maybe not, but its % dot products"
12207,The build Im driving right now is almost there. FSD will blow your mind.
12208,"Expansion will be gradual, based on ensuring maximum safety"
12209,Am I a yoke to you?
12210,Yet another round wheel is boring &amp; blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke.
12211,Just messin with ya haha
12212,Are you the same today as you were yesterday?
12213,It seems to be working
12214,Cybertruck is not like the others
12215,That sums it up well!
12216,Thanks! What is your favorite tea?
12217,"And if it doesnt work, hes gonna sue death!"
12218,Impressive!
12219,Worth it
12220,Many times
12221,Thats one of my tests!
12222,Tesla audio engineering is great
12223,Im not always late haha
12224,"Large incumbent carmakers sell their cars at low to zero true margin. Most of their profit is selling replacement parts to their fleet, of which % to % are past warranty. Like razors &amp; blades. New car companies lack this advantage. Also lack sales &amp; service infrastructure."
12225,Production is hard. Production with positive cash flow is extremely hard.
12226,Korolev was amazing
12227,Lot of good work happening on Tesla sound codec &amp; audio software in general. Aiming for maximum music dopamine in your brain!
12228,Yes
12229,A lot has happened in the past years
12230,"This is obv debatable, but Id call anything with ~300 miles / ~500 km of true usable travel distance long range, beyond that very long range"
12231,"There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel. For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron. Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft."
12232,Our new cell is mm diameter with steel shell &amp; even that was huge challenge for propagation resistance
12233,"Yes. Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots. Then, pressure &amp; heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning. Pretty basic."
12234,Time is the ultimate currency
12235,"Iron, the last element made in a star, appears likely to exceed nickel by :1 or more"
12236,"Generally agree, but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use."
12237,And Beta is a step change improvement from what you have!
12238,Im fkn tryin
12239,"Ur welcome, pls be nice to the humans"
12240,Smoked ham
12241,"Good progress. Applying information theory to currency (which is just information), lower fees reduce noise &amp; faster &amp; more consistent sync time improve latency &amp; jitter."
12242,"The robots are coming anyway, as Boston Dynamics videos clearly show. I will not be able to ensure that robots made by other companies are safe, but I can try my best to do so at Tesla."
12243,"In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics."
12244,"Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber &amp; shorter path. Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!"
12245,"Not sure, but maybe a few months. In general for any region, we need to make software work well, test it extensively &amp; then get regulatory approval. If we could go faster while being safe, we would!"
12246,Yes
12247,What is love?
12248,"That is the aspiration, but we need to be cautious. Safety is always paramount at Tesla."
12249,"I mostly run alpha software in my car, which is not meant for public consumption. A few days before release, I switch my car to what public will experience."
12250,"Looks promising that Beta , about weeks later, will be good enough for public opt in request button"
12251,FSD Beta rolls out midnight Friday next week
12252,"I was in the Berlin paint shop talking to the team on my last visit. Its gonna be great! But bear in mind that it takes about a year for a new factory to reach volume production. Production is super hard work, which is why I have great respect for those who do it."
12253,They can shake their fist at the sky
12254,Norway FTW
12255,Our new crane!
12256,"has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages, so it wouldnt matter if we had new products, as none would ship. Assuming is not mega drama, new Roadster should ship in ."
12257,Great shots by
12258,Maybe zap him on the head with our space lasers
12259,"Technically, data packets do not need to touch regular Internet data can flow from user terminal to satellite/s to user terminal"
12260,"Our satellites launching in next few months have inter-satellite laser links, so no local downlink needed. Probably active in to months."
12261,Filing legal actions against SpaceX is *actually* his full-time job
12262,"He should consider spending some money on actual lunar lander hardware, instead of shady lobbyists"
12263,Yup
12264,Just figuring out the regulatory approval process
12265,Sigh
12266,"Good point, agreed."
12267,This might be part of the problem: GM is warning owners not to charge their Bolts in or near their homes overnight
12268,Big Ass Fans are great!
12269,The dark side of OnlyFans
12270,Time to stop projecting &amp; cool off
12271,"No worries, situation is under control"
12272,True
12273,Thank for bringing this up. Tesla will expedite service center openings. Have you tried our mobile service that comes to you?
12274,Beta coming soon!
12275,Am watching Star Wars: Bad Batch with lil baby X. Waiting for Season !
12276,Stop projecting!
12277,Hopefully first try with booster
12278,Stage Zero
12279,Tank treads on the arms
12280,"Booster has pins for lifting &amp; catching, although maybe its better to modify grid fins to take more load. Something will need to flip out from leeward side of top of ship to do same there. Maybe its part of fwd flaps, but prob not. Diff solutions for diff load paths."
12281,"SpaceX will try to catch largest ever flying object with robot chopsticks. Success is not guaranteed, but excitement is!"
12282,~110k
12283,I added the Archangel-12 part and obviously have a fondness for the letter X
12284,Doffs
12285,The beauty of physics (truth)
12286,Important
12287,Exactly
12288,Good to see you &amp; at Starbase
12289,The rocket fleet grows
12290,Falcon about to launch Dragon to
12291,Black
12292,Of course
12293,Flying over Starbase
12294,Ok
12295,"Yeah, we should tie Autopilot driving style preference &amp; various warning settings together in general"
12296,"Dont want to be unreasonable, but maybe they should be required to deliver at least one vehicle per billion dollars of valuation *before* the IPO?"
12297,Sure
12298,Good point
12299,Pretty much
12300,Yes
12301,"I thought was peak insanity, but is % more insane!"
12302,"Good point. We do have torque reduction if an obstacle is detected, but active braking would be better. Prime directive is: do not crash."
12303,Impressive render. Warts &amp; all! New version of Raptor is much cleaner.
12304,Turns out Besos retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX
12305,"Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel &amp; iron. Id personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to %, whereas nickel prefers ~90%."
12306,weeks
12307,"This is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor"
12308,Beta will be next-level
12309,is a hydrogen sonata
12310,Tesla China rocks!
12311,Nice
12312,"We should be there with Beta , which goes out a week from Friday (no point release this week). It will have a completely retrained NN, so will need another few weeks after that for tuning &amp; bug fixes. Best guess is public beta button in ~4 weeks."
12313,"In general, we overfit to SF Bay Area"
12314,Nothings perfect haha
12315,"Its amazing by most standards, but we are aiming for % safer than the average human driver"
12316,Cant wait for new high bay!
12317,Just drove FSD Beta from Pasadena to LAX. Much improved!
12318,Nope
12319,Our license applications are pending in many more countries. Hoping to serve Earth soon!
12320,Ancient Doges
12321,Now serving
12322,k terminals shipped!
12323,Nine rings for mortal men
12324,"FSD Beta is actually not great imo, but Autopilot/AI team is rallying to improve as fast as possible. Were trying to have a single stack for both highway &amp; city streets, but it requires massive NN retraining."
12325,The Guns of August
12326,Its basically the plot of Fallout: New Vegas
12327,"There is a profound difference between single-planet &amp; multiplanet species. If we are able to visit other stars one day, we may discover many long-dead single-planet civilizations."
12328,To extend the light of consciousness
12329,Summarized well
12330,I never said this!
12331,My son asked if we would still speak English years from now. I said probably not. There was not even the faintest hint of English years ago.
12332,Deep cut haha
12333,Hopefully
12334,"Bot is not directly on the path of accelerating a sustainable energy future, but it aspirationally improves the probability that the future is good"
12335,Pretty wild
12336,True
12337,Do they even know about the delta variant!?
12338,Yes
12339,Its a quintillion (10^18) floating point operations per second enough to simulate a human brain
12340,"We have almost all the pieces needed for humanoid robots, since we already make robots with wheels"
12341,On now
12342,Will make a big difference
12343,"No, bottom static aero pushes engine section back, counteracting Starships low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section. Aiming for to deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight. Dont want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma."
12344,Low center of mass. Bit like our ship &amp; booster on reentry.
12345,Same
12346,"Probably slightly further forward, smaller, more inward. No funny looking static aero at top, as static aero no longer directly in flow."
12347,"Btw, theres a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control, but passive section is counter-productive, as it pushes nose backwards. New design rotates fwd flaps more to leeward &amp; further forward to improve moment arm. Maybe ~120 deg apart."
12348,Product ideas!
12349,True
12350,You can make anything fly haha
12351,Yes
12352,Impressive
12353,Robyn is great
12354,"Beta or maybe . Going to pure vision set us back initially. Vision plus (coarse) radar had us trapped in a local maximum, like a level cap. Pure vision requires fairly advanced real-world AI, but thats how our whole road system is designed to work: NNs with vision."
12355,", probably &amp; then maybe . Significant architecture changes in ."
12356,Improvements in :
12357,Some unexpected last minute issues. Should go out in next day or two.
12358,Real time
12359,"First orbital stack of Starship should be ready for flight in a few weeks, pending only regulatory approval"
12360,Probably sooner
12361,We will make it happen!
12362,Shower thoughts work best for me
12363,Dont look here!
12364,Were working on enabling public access to our restaurant!
12365,Solar/wind + batteries + electric cars is obviously the future
12366,Ive been saying this for a while
12367,Mad respect for the makers
12368,Demolition Man is coming true
12369,Starship will enable humanity to become a multiplanet species
12370,Major Supercharger openings in west LA coming soon!
12371,"Starship will be crushingly cost-effective for Earth orbit or moon missions as soon as its operational &amp; rapid reuse is happening. Mars is a lot harder, because Earth &amp; Mars only align every months, so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over to year life of ship."
12372,"All models do make use of aluminum casting, but new Y will be most advanced with /3 of body cast."
12373,"Sorry, its been pretty intense lately"
12374,Same
12375,I have great respect for Kathy Lueders
12376,"Actual volume manufacturing, where cash in &gt; cash out, is so damn hard most people have no idea"
12377,"The sad thing is that even if Santa Claus suddenly made their hardware real for free, the first thing youd want to do is cancel it"
12378,Super agree!
12379,Seriously
12380,"In the end, its all about entropy"
12381,Touch
12382,"Soon, Mechazilla will have arms!"
12383,Natrlich
12384,Vorfreude Waldeinsamkeit
12385,Pics or didn hapn oh
12386,As Jeffrey Besos is amply demonstrating
12387,No amount of money can defy physics
12388,Twitter DM laughing emoji is nightmare
12389,Yes on both counts. That would be a great outcome for civilization.
12390,"Preferably, on Mars"
12391,I will welcome death when it comes
12392,"And ship will be caught by Mechazilla too. As with booster, no landing legs. Those are only needed for moon &amp; Mars until there is local infrastructure."
12393,Pretty close. Booster &amp; arms will move faster. QD arm will steady booster for ship mate.
12394,"Priority for residents of Brandenburg &amp; Berlin, but also open to general public"
12395,Giga Berlin-Brandenburg county fair &amp; factory tour on October!
12396,Iron(y)man
12397,The staying power of a bad idea is astonishing
12398,"Note, should be refill, not refuel. ~78% of propellant is liquid oxygen, only ~22% is fuel."
12399,"Tesla makes cars for export in first half of quarter &amp; for local market in second half. As publicly disclosed, we are operating under extreme supply chain limitations regarding certain standard automotive chips. Most problematic by far are Renesas &amp; Bosch."
12400,"Booster &amp; Ship will return to orbital launch pad on Monday (winds allowing). Just finishing off some small plumbing &amp; wiring, which is easier in high bay."
12401,I hope I do
12402,Yup
12403,"If lobbying &amp; lawyers could get u to orbit, Bezos would be on Pluto rn"
12404,Exactly
12405,"Somehow, this wasnt convincing"
12406,Id recommend they get their first plant working. Its insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.
12407,Its gonna be awesome
12408,Yup
12409,"However, even if it were flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than orbital flights in first half of &amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over times."
12410,"flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of to fill ton tanks of lunar Starship. Without flaps &amp; heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs dont add much (1/6 gravity). May only need /2 full, ie tanker flights."
12411,Yeah
12412,"Important to bear in mind that production is as fast as the slowest part out of ~10,000 unique parts in a car"
12413,SpaceX could do it if need be
12414,Seems like too many cooks in the kitchen
12415,What really matters for the longevity of civilization is making life multiplanetary on a sustained basis
12416,Believe in the future
12417,Always loved those Empire State photos with people eating lunch out on the beam
12418,"Agreed, this is not the time to pick technology winners or losers in cryptocurrency technology. There is no crisis that compels hasty legislation."
12419,Long time
12420,An honor to work with such a great team
12421,Sure
12422,It will be exciting to see what new cultures humanity creates on other heavenly bodies!
12423,"Due to its size &amp; ability to return science instruments even from deep space, Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions"
12424,Minus the lifts
12425,"There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built its an insanely hard problem. Moreover, it must be rapidly &amp; completely reusable (like an airplane). This is the only way to make life multiplanetary. Efficiencies of scale is why Starship is so large."
12426,Ok
12427,"Higher structural margins overall are needed for reuse, plus: Booster - Grid fins for aero control - Boostback &amp; landing propellant tanks - Protecting engines from entry loads Ship - Body flaps for aero control - Deorbit &amp; landing propellant tanks - Heat shield"
12428,Inevitably
12429,"Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isnt obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V."
12430,"It is ~98% done, but the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining"
12431,significant items: - Final heat shield tiles for ship - Thermal protection of booster engines - Ground propellant storage tanks - QD arm for ship weeks.
12432,Dream come true
12433,Absolutely
12434,Starship Fully Stacked
12435,Probably
12436,"Tesla Automation (Deutschland) built a specialized machine to wrap the rotor with carbon fiber at precise tension. If too low, it would come loose at low temp, due to CTE differences. If too high, it would snap at high temp &amp; rpm."
12437,"Total coincidence! Also, booster height was originally m, but we eliminated a half barrel for manufacturing efficiency, so now its"
12438,DMTwitter
12439,"Reality is total opposite of what detractors say! Biggest challenge is recruiting enough people to build cars. SF Bay Area essentially has negative unemployment, so people at our factory have several other job offers. If they werent treated well, they would leave immediately!"
12440,"Once Mechazilla is operational, winds will rarely be an issue"
12441,Winds are too high today. Looks like wind speed will be low enough to stack early tomorrow morning.
12442,Remaining tiles are on their way!
12443,Irony indeed
12444,Aiming to stack ship on booster today
12445,"That was fun! I was operating on limited sleep &amp; serious back pain, so not at my best. Its awesome that you know so much about how rockets work &amp; their development history. Am happy to do another factory tour in a month or two and talk about whats changed since last time."
12446,It would be an honor to have you visit Starbase
12447,"Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasnt invited"
12448,Hes shadowed me for several days so far
12449,Makes sense
12450,"Yeah, theyre all good, but I particularly liked his biography of Ben Franklin"
12451,Maybe one day
12452,"If youre curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp; my general goings on, is writing a biography"
12453,"I have great admiration for Johns engineering ability! What he did with Armadillo was incredible. Ive tried to convince him many times to join SpaceX, but he has always declined (sigh)."
12454,"Mechazilla will do this for future rockets, but its not quite ready yet"
12455,Moving rocket to orbital launch pad
12456,That is the goal. Our official name is actually Space Exploration Technologies. SpaceX is short form.
12457,"I do think that great design &amp; engineering of products are critical, but manufacturing &amp; supply chain require orders of magnitude more work"
12458,All engines mounted to first orbital Starship
12459,"I thought we had lost for sure. We were just a tiny company back then, only of launches got to orbit &amp; I had no money left. Out of the blue, a few days before Christmas, NASA calls to say we won."
12460,"Just want to say thanks to those in government who fight hard for the right thing to happen, despite extreme pressure to do otherwise. Therein lies the core goodness of the American state."
12461,"I do love NASA, always have"
12462,Its true
12463,The sheer amount of time Tesla has spent dealing with bike lane is staggering. Short answer yes.
12464,Mars looks amazing
12465,We stole the idea from Karate Kid
12466,"Pitch control requires more force than yaw &amp; much more force than roll. Also, grid fins closer to or in the wake of the booster are less effective. However, pretty good aero control can technically be achieved with only grid fins, with some effect on accuracy."
12467,Thanks Sandy!
12468,Super Heavy Booster moving to orbital launch mount
12469,"Very close to real! Arms are able to move during descent to match exact booster position. Catch point is off to side, in case catch fails dont want to hit launch mount. Booster is transferred back to launch mount for next flight. Designed to have &lt;1 hour turnaround."
12470,Thats about right. Civilization can be powered with a very small % of Earth having solar panels.
12471,"Hard to believe its been years already. Those goals actually precede the creation of Tesla by many years. Goes back to probably ~1992 when I was in college. However, at the time, I thought the chance of achieving those goals was very low."
12472,I was asked by a reporter if I was optimistic or pessimistic about SpaceXs future. That was my answer.
12473,was an extremely tough year on every level
12474,It was difficult
12475,Raptors on Super Heavy
12476,"First birds werent real, now bugs arent real either!?"
12477,Installing Starship booster engines for first orbital flight
12478,Needs to be level &amp; match booster fittings. We will find out on ~Tuesday.
12479,I do spend a bit of time pontificating tbh
12480,It is inspired by Cyberpunk
12481,Neuralink company bar
12482,"Replacement rate is , so roughly generations, but lets try to avoid this!"
12483,It really is all about the journey!
12484,We are doing releases every weeks on Friday at midnight California time
12485,tons
12486,They do
12487,"Reason we hustled so much to get Autopilot V1 out was that someone driving non-Autopilot Tesla fell asleep, crashed &amp; killed cyclist (Tesla driver was uninjured). Driver nonetheless sued us saying new car smell made him fall asleep (sigh). Judge didnt agree."
12488,Starbase is moving at Warp
12489,"Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work, but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not. Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity &amp; so reduce landing propellant might have better performance. Not sure. Potential future optimization."
12490,The Tesla AI predictions are swiftly becoming superhuman its guesses for what it cant see well feel like ESP. It has a vastly larger training set than any human &amp; thinks only about driving.
12491,"There is always a lot of cleanup after a major code release. Beta will be tight. Still some fundamentals to solve for Beta , but now that were pure vision, progress is much faster. Radar was holding us back."
12492,Will post once we have a decent simulation. Our first design will probably be far from the bullseye.
12493,"Stage Zero, which is everything needed to launch &amp; catch the rocket, is at least as hard as the booster or ship"
12494,"PC desktop with latest graphics card, although I have a Mac too. Gigabyte laptop."
12495,Two weeks (actually)
12496,Yup
12497,A wheel of cheese
12498,Yes
12499,Snatched from the sky by Mechazilla
12500,Hadnt showered in several days. We are going hardcore with Starbase Surge.
12501,It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
12502,"Tesla policy is never to give in to false claims, even if we would lose, and never to fight true claims, even if we would win."
12503,"If we are wrong, we are wrong. In this case, we were."
12504,"Yeah, Liftoff is solid"
12505,"Indeed. Both Cook &amp; I have been clear publicly that we have never spoken or otherwise communicated. I tried to speak to him &amp; he declined. Nor have I ever expressed any interest in running Apple to anyone. Cook is, all things considered, obviously doing an incredible job."
12506,He does like to play with my phone. There are many confusing videos he has taken.
12507,"Sorry, accidental tap!"
12508,"Thats arguably a security issue, but allowing companies to use other payment options, especially for in-app purchases would be fair. As soon as they allowed that, they would have to lower their fees. As for the cost of reviewing apps for security, a fixed fee makes sense."
12509,"Normally, competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees, but Apple &amp; Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account, its basically a monopoly. The effective % sales tax Apple charges is hidden from users or there would be an outcry."
12510,I dont want to be CEO of anything
12511,Top feature request for sure
12512,"Actually, I like &amp; use Apple products. They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean % fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable. Epic wouldnt bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair."
12513,GAO
12514,Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.
12515,Cook &amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about % of todays value.
12516,Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring
12517,Maximum set of possible future actions
12518,Only thing beyond ludicrous is Plaid
12519,Haha
12520,Prometheus Unbound
12521,Exactly
12522,A lot
12523,"This should be clear to anyone who has experienced the FSD beta evolution. Self-driving requires solving a major part of real-world AI, so its an insanely hard problem, but Tesla is getting it done. AI Day will be great."
12524,We are a pattern of ancient atoms
12525,Mass to orbit is the fundamental metric for making life multiplanetary
12526,Upmass is what matters. One Starship will lift what all Falcons did in Q2 on a single flight.
12527,Wow
12528,"Indeed, there are some giant mosquitoes around here!"
12529,So many tubes
12530,"Raptor V2.0 is a major improvement in simplication, while also increasing thrust from ~185 tons to ~230 tons. Long-term goal is engine cost below $1000/ton of thrust."
12531,And thats just the primary fuel lines! The maze of secondary plumbing &amp; wiring is our greatest concern.
12532,"Yeah, SpaceX team is cranking hard!"
12533,I mean of course
12534,Completing feed system for Raptor rocket engines on Super Heavy Booster
12535,Feels so long ago
12536,Haha true. I talked to my friends about electric cars constantly in college.
12537,Congrats!
12538,Congratulations!
12539,True
12540,Yeah
12541,Dojo is designed for NN training. No emulation needed.
12542,Convincing the best AI talent to join Tesla is the sole goal
12543,Tesla AI Day August th
12544,Nice
12545,"Haha ok, I will do the Tesla shareholder meeting in a posh British accent"
12546,"These guys are either shady, or both. I mean seriously theres a long list of companies to pick on before Tesla"
12547,"At this point, just count atoms &amp; dispense with nm"
12548,"We dont have that many Bitcoin, but its close"
12549,Congrats SpaceX tower team &amp; supporting contractors!
12550,"Orbital precession takes a long time. With Starship &amp; Starlink V2.0, hopefully we can direct inject to target orbit."
12551,Haha
12552,I am already chewing on so much glass that I have chipmunk cheeks!
12553,Im so dying to do a supersonic vtol electric jet! But I already have way too much on my plate. Any more work and my brain will explode.
12554,"Thats a low bar. Carmakers have never valued software engineering highly, although VW is trying to change that. I personally wrote software for years &amp; have huge respect for software engineers. Tesla is on par with best software companies &amp; is leader in real world AI."
12555,"Tesla software team is excellent even when compared to the best software companies. This is a big deal, as cars are very much computers on wheels."
12556,Great work by Tesla Giga Berlin team &amp; supporting contractors!
12557,Good thread
12558,Fair enough
12559,And thats just for Earth! Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.
12560,Population collapse is potentially the greatest risk to the future of civilization
12561,"Cars today are far more complex than Model T, with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk. Like Model T, supply chain for battery EVs simply doesnt exist at massive scale, so must be built in parallel. Ideas are easy, production is hard."
12562,"Ships are probably fine with iron cells, but aircraft need very high energy density for good range. Im not saying Tesla will do aircraft we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation just that max energy density is needed for aircraft."
12563,Indeed
12564,"Only a little taller, but much bigger base &amp; two gantry cranes that run full span"
12565,"We will try. Preferable for Tesla too, as they last so long. Unlike other makers of cars, our goal is *not* to profit from service. Best service is not needing service in the first place."
12566,The Biggest Bang Theory
12567,Probably in a few months
12568,Amazing
12569,That is the acid test
12570,Computers are absurdly more accurate than humans. How long would it take for a human to render even one frame of a modern video game at low res? The computer will do high res at frames per second. Not a contest.
12571,Quaternions are important for orbital spaceflight
12572,Cool
12573,"although to be fair, I dig my own grave a lot"
12574,"Austin now, but back at Starbase tomorrow"
12575,Norway has played a major role in supporting advent of electric vehicles!
12576,"Seriously, were getting eaten alive. Cant get to Mars if the bugs eat us first."
12577,Length will grow by ~500 ft over time
12578,"The building is ~7 stores tall, so each floor is double size. Hard to appreciate unless youre close."
12579,I was at Giga Texas yesterday. Team is making excellent progress. Building will be almost a mile long when complete.
12580,Construction starts soon on a much larger high bay just north of current high bay
12581,Several improvements coming via V9.1 on Friday at midnight
12582,Tesla Giga Shanghai team has done amazing work!
12583,And finally
12584,Or does he?
12585,weeks
12586,Haha
12587,Is the Pope Catholic?
12588,That was me after Cyberpunk Razor fight haha
12589,Being thanked by game NPCs brought me real joy tbh
12590,The comments on this article are funny
12591,"Large pouch cells undergo significant volumetric changes at high state of charge. Even so, fire risk is probably less than gasoline cars. There are over combustion engine car fires every year in US alone. Its literally in the name."
12592,Sure
12593,"Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport."
12594,Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is! Body diameter (9m or ft) is bigger than a or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket. Making life multiplanetary means massive rockets. Got to be done.
12595,More of a pathfinder test. Actual payload bay door dimensions are still under debate. Volume is ~1000 cubic meters. Roomy
12596,Thats the goal!
12597,The feeling is mutual. But I cant emphasize enough that we work with an amazing team. The credit is theirs.
12598,Maybe I will. Its on PC now.
12599,"I couldnt do WoW. Awesome, but too much time required."
12600,Great game
12601,"If Tesla is able to succeed with imported vehicles, then a factory in India is quite likely."
12602,Very impressive!
12603,But we are hopeful that there will be at least a temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles. That would be much appreciated.
12604,"We want to do so, but import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country! Moreover, clean energy vehicles are treated the same as diesel or petrol, which does not seem entirely consistent with the climate goals of India."
12605,Tesla Model S Plaid is alien technology
12606,No
12607,"Also, the full self-driving interface renders across the whole display &amp; it is incredible. The yoke enables an unobstructed view of the screen."
12608,"Good review &amp; fair critique. In general with interfaces, all input is error. With each software update, the cars intuition will get better. You will need to press buttons less &amp; less &amp; it will know when to ignore accidental button presses."
12609,Minimizing $/ton to the surface of Mars is the fundamental optimization
12610,This will become very important over time
12611,Flight tests showed that we could make body flaps narrower &amp; lighter
12612,Also lasts much longer than normal roofs &amp; is able to withstand hail &amp; other medium-sized impacts
12613,Congrats Cathie!
12614,"Seriously, negative nominal interest rates!? What is the world coming to"
12615,"But, much more important, is that this *design* is capable of full &amp; rapid reusability. Long way to go from design to making it actually fully &amp; rapidly reusable with high payload, but at least success is *one* of the possible outcomes haha."
12616,"Dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries. That said, it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwells proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production &amp; were still not quite done."
12617,"Ironic indeed, as I was at one point going to do my PhD at Stanford on high energy density capacitors for use in electric vehicles. But lithium-ion has it covered. Even with no advances in lithium-ion technology, its possible to transition Earth to sustainable energy."
12618,Nice
12619,"Over time, all countries"
12620,Congrats!
12621,"We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. Its one fairly slim connector for both low &amp; high power charging. That said, were making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year."
12622,Great to hear!
12623,Best of luck tomorrow!
12624,Haha
12625,"Depending on progress with Booster , we might try a engine firing on Booster"
12626,Full test duration firing of Raptors on Super Heavy Booster!
12627,"Sure, I have a ton"
12628,"During this talk, we will sing a cover of The Final Countdown by Europe"
12629,Nice
12630,Haha
12631,You dont even need to touch the shifter in new S. Auto detect direction will come as an optional setting to all cars with FSD.
12632,"Problem st, theory nd is for sure way to go, as it establishes relevance, thus improving memory retention"
12633,Cybrrrtruck
12634,And all-time hodl champion
12635,OG Hipster
12636,Indeed
12637,Pohtaytohz
12638,"Current Summon is sometimes useful, but mostly just a fun trick. Once we move summon (plus highway driving) to a single FSD stack, it will be sublime."
12639,Cool!
12640,"Theres a corner case where brick density is same density as water, reaching bottom due to momentum"
12641,Fred Astaire is incredible. Worth watching his movies. One of a kind.
12642,Haha
12643,"Now, he can bench press a rhino"
12644,Nice
12645,Tap on the screen
12646,Lil X is hodling his Doge like a champ. Literally never said the word sell even once!
12647,All your basis points are belong to us - fiat issuers
12648,A classic
12649,True
12650,Haha
12651,Roughly
12652,Yes
12653,"Wide beta maybe with FSD rev , definitely with rev"
12654,Pure coincidence!
12655,Even smaller to a chip
12656,"To date, AI chatbots have had a rather short MtH (meantime to Hitler) score. Tay was ~16 hours."
12657,"Some of these design trades are still open, but will be resolved soon"
12658,Very accurate!
12659,Improving permit approval speed &amp; lowering permit costs for solar would make a big difference
12660,Do you even press?
12661,"Indeed, but again like a parking lot, a battery having big roads tends to decrease number of parking spaces (ie stores less energy)"
12662,Those are major factors
12663,Absolutely!
12664,Probably Monday
12665,Yes
12666,"FSD beta is using the pure vision production code for highway driving. Beta hopefully (Beta definitely) will use one stack to rule them all city streets, highway &amp; complex parking lots."
12667,How about a wifi camera link?
12668,"In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here &amp; there to make it slightly better. No door handles. Car recognizes you &amp; opens door. Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling &amp; tight turns!"
12669,Version of the SpaceX droneship. Team did great work! Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship.
12670,"To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. I dont care. I love it so much even if others dont. Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future."
12671,"Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full parking lot. Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full."
12672,"Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range. Supercharger network is being upgraded to kW to kW, so that will help too."
12673,"Yeah, I wuz running on almost no sleep"
12674,Yup
12675,Some traffic could just go terminal -&gt; satellite -&gt; satellite -&gt; terminal and never touch the regular Internet
12676,Good point
12677,"If we can do this successfully, then anything developed for ground/undersea fiber is automatically better in orbit"
12678,"Similar to fiber optic. We are trying to ride the terrestrial fiber optic laser technology forcing function, but modified for use in vacuum."
12679,Yeah
12680,"Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as %, due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber"
12681,"More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences. Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms."
12682,A new laughing emoji on DMs would be great
12683,"Glad its working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing. Ping should improve dramatically in coming months. Were aiming for &lt;20ms. Basically, you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink."
12684,Review of Model S Plaid by Dan Neil
12685,Yeah
12686,Some light reading with lil X
12687,"Due to lack of banging, civilization might ended with a whimper! Adult diaper sales growth is much higher than baby diaper sales growth."
12688,"This is a major problem! Between civilization ending with a bang or a whimper, this trend suggests the latter."
12689,Congratulations!
12690,Next baby will be a girl
12691,Me too!
12692,"Im trying to set a good example! Population collapse is a much bigger problem than people realize and thats just for Earth. Mars has a great need for people, seeing as population is currently zero. Humans are the custodians of other life on Earth. Let us bring life to Mars!"
12693,"It was Richards rental house, which overall is great, but I agree regarding the cabinets haha. This was am, day of flight. Wasnt expecting this brutal pic of me to be posted, but oh well."
12694,Indeed sigh
12695,Im trying to set a good example!
12696,Population collapse is whats actually happening
12697,Booster is more than half cost of mission. Fairing is ~10%.
12698,Any money transmitter or other licenses needed to use this in USA?
12699,"Took more work to make F9 booster reuse cost-effective than went into recovering it in the first place. This is an important point. Things finally clicked into place with Block . My hat is off to everyone at SpaceX, NASA, Space Force, FAA &amp; suppliers who helped make it happen."
12700,"Im actually years old, but, at the risk of being immodest, I think I look good even for years! Still have my original chariot license in papyrus"
12701,those who attack space maybe dont realize that space represents hope for so many people
12702,"Loki is pretty good. Basically, live-action with a long romance ark."
12703,"Maybe if it sees a Shiba Inu, the car renders a Dogecoin"
12704,Haha Buzz Corp made of buzzwords
12705,Interesting idea
12706,"Not yet, but they will. Its needed for full self-driving."
12707,OPP?
12708,Corporate-speak is human Ambien
12709,"Its true, x is a toddler hodler. Never once has he said sell!"
12710,Exactly
12711,"Action will follow recognition soon thereafter. Also, call will listen for sirens &amp; alarms."
12712,"It will soon capture turn signals, hazards, ambulance/police lights &amp; even hand gestures"
12713,Spaceport design is cool
12714,"Final decision made earlier this week on booster engine count. Will be at ~230 (half million lbs) sea-level thrust. All engines on booster are same, apart from deleting gimbal &amp; thrust vector actuators for outer ."
12715,"Congratulations, beautiful flight!"
12716,Godspeed!
12717,Yes. It will be the highest output &amp; most advanced rocket engine factory in the world.
12718,The challenges of operating at Starbase left us with no choice but to put engine production in McGregor
12719,Thanks Austin
12720,"Roughly to per year. Thats about whats needed over ten years to create the fleet to build a self-sustaining city on Mars. City itself probably takes roughly years, so hopefully it is built by ~2050."
12721,McGregor
12722,"By volume production, I mean to engines per day. Thats super high volume for big rocket engines, but low volume by automotive standards."
12723,"We are breaking ground soon on a second Raptor factory at SpaceX Texas test site. This will focus on volume production of Raptor , while California factory will make Raptor Vacuum &amp; new, experimental designs."
12724,"Yeah, goal is to reflect reality, so screen render will become increasingly so"
12725,"Accurate assessment. Btw, Autopilot software is technically led by Ashok, Andrej &amp; Milan, but its very much a knights of the round table structure. There are so many talented engineers on Autopilot/AI team &amp; they decide for themselves what to work on. Kinda like Valve."
12726,Mind of car visualization will improve a lot in coming releases. Brightness/translucency indicate confidence of neural net in predicting any given object. Acid test is being able to assess with quick glance at screen if car fully understands environment.
12727,Only ever have
12728,"Indeed, Loki is quiet good"
12729,Will see you there to wish you the best
12730,Fellowship of the Raptors
12731,"Technically, high voltage DC is the most efficient way to transmit electricity, but they lacked good power electronics back then"
12732,Dragon returning from orbit
12733,"It wont need to reach visa speed, as regulated exchanges will act as de facto second layer. But the perfect should not be the enemy of the good it is still good to increase base layer transaction speed &amp; lower base layer transaction cost."
12734,Block size &amp; frequency should steadily increase to match broadly available bandwidth
12735,"When even someone in California, home of Silicon Valley, needs Internet so bad that they bolt a Starlink dish to the hood of their car, you know theres a serious unmet need!"
12736,Yes
12737,Just add salt
12738,Absolutely
12739,Solar + Powerwall battery ensures that your home never loses power
12740,Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall in major new housing development in Austin
12741,"Autonomous SpaceX droneship, A Shortfall of Gravitas"
12742,Yes
12743,"BTC &amp; ETH are pursuing a multilayer transaction system, but base layer transaction rate is slow &amp; transaction cost is high. There is merit imo to Doge maximizing base layer transaction rate &amp; minimizing transaction cost with exchanges acting as the de facto secondary layer."
12744,Sigh
12745,"Running preproduction software is both work &amp; fun. Beta list was in stasis, as we had many known issues to fix. Beta addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid. Safety is always top priority at Tesla."
12746,Hard to beat the Great Pyramid!
12747,"Sanskrit is ancient &amp; amazing, but Archaic Sumerian is generally agreed to be oldest written language. As for what was first spoken, its hard to say, as no one wrote it down! So much history has been lost due to lack of writing (on something durable)."
12748,Maybe that movie gaslit us all
12749,Listening to History of English podcast
12750,Tropic Thunder is so good
12751,Gas lit by gas light
12752,That is the impression that some have Traveling to another planet &amp; building a self-sustaining city is not for the faint of heart. Consider the sad case of Chad (RIP)
12753,But also this
12754,This
12755,Kinda true
12756,Cartesian Duelists
12757,Haha
12758,I can sometimes be optimistic about schedules
12759,This sounds like it has potential to go wrong &amp; Im not referring to reusing code
12760,True
12761,"An old video. Ah, those were simpler times"
12762,And also accelerates sustainable energy
12763,Finally some tongue
12764,"Beta will start uploading at midnight California time on Friday. Bear in mind, it is still just a beta!"
12765,"Depends on how the limited beta goes. If it goes well, maybe a month or so."
12766,Improved FSD screen. Attempting to show the mind of the car.
12767,Saturday
12768,Releasing Beta V9 end of week
12769,"Also, the British legal system in"
12770,I love this
12771,Expect rapid improvement with pure vision
12772,Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia (to Serbian parents)!
12773,Yes
12774,"And by , Tesla production will exceed the mass of the Universe!"
12775,"Yeah, that would be cool. Also, using ship itself as structure for new giant telescope thats &gt;10X Hubble resolution. Was talking to Saul Perlmutter (whos awesome) &amp; he suggested wanting to do that."
12776,Supersonic shock wave
12777,"We could stretch the Falcon Heavy upper stage &amp; increase this a lot, but FH already covers all known payloads. Starship, especially with orbital refilling &amp; dedicated deep space variants (no heatshield, flaps or header tanks) will take this up orders of magnitude."
12778,Absolutely! Staggeringly insane amount of work between now and then.
12779,High res landing Falcon landing video
12780,Accurate. Show that Falcon Heavy addresses all use cases.
12781,"Working with Weddle and Sons Roofing has been a great collaboration for accelerating Tesla Solar Roof installation! This is a lot of work, as tens of millions of homes need solar roofs! If you are a roofing company, please consider adding Solar Roof to your offerings."
12782,Douglas Adams ftw
12783,Mass Effect was particularly great
12784,Warren Buffet Sizzler buffet
12785,"Caused by switching frequency of light source. Surround video (multiple cameras, across several frames), improving fps &amp; exposure setting tweaks solves this. All in FSD build."
12786,"Yes, updated UI coming with FSD wide release. All cars with FSD computer will have new mind of car view. All /Y can be upgraded to have FSD computer."
12787,Soft spot for olde Roadster
12788,but srsly the pic clicking is so annoying!
12789,Its awesome
12790,"L/D makes quite a big difference. We do care about lift for Starship much more than Dragon, as lower peak heating is needed for reusability of heat shield. Dragon prefers high peak, low total heat load, as it is driven by tile heat pulse reaching bondline while under parachutes."
12791,Stop sending me this $h1t
12792,"Design is easy, production is hard"
12793,Free Britney
12794,"Booster engines are not shrouded by skirt extension, as with ship. Engines extend about m below booster."
12795,Its one possibility
12796,Kinda has to happen
12797,"Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor . Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more Isp). Adding more R-Vac to ship with max Isp maybe"
12798,"All Raptors on booster, whether fixed or gimbaling, would be the same. *230 gets ~7600 tons of thrust &amp; T/W of ~1.5."
12799,Looking good at ~378 sec. Continued improvement will get it over .
12800,Happy th to all!
12801,Bless America
12802,Current plan is to increase base Raptor thrust to ~230 tons or ~500 million lbs &amp; increase booster engine count to or
12803,Regen (using motor) braking means brake pads almost never need to be replaced
12804,Cool
12805,"Outer engine ring is fixed angle, but can throttle"
12806,"Yes, we can fly Starship around space &amp; chomp up debris with the moving fairing door"
12807,New SpaceX Starlink cover shows transfer orbit from Earth to Mars
12808,"Haha, FSD beta is shipping soon, I swear! Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. Didnt expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect. Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality."
12809,There is a big difference between reaching space and reaching orbit
12810,"Friday afternoons are usually Tesla design studio time. Cybertruck will be almost exactly what was shown. Were adding rear wheel steering, so it can do tight turns &amp; maneuver with high agility. Lot of other great things coming."
12811,Fair enough
12812,Both great
12813,Two weeks
12814,"Yes. Long-term, all settings will be in your Tesla app and car will auto adjust."
12815,Epic!
12816,"Toxoplasmosis infects rats, then cats, then humans who make cat videos. AI trains achieves superhuman intelligence training on Internet cat videos, thus making toxoplasmosis the true arbiter of our destiny."
12817,"Yeah, main story line is not that long. Played at max difficulty, no aim assist, so didnt softball it. Razor fight was insanely difficult."
12818,"Congrats Tesla Team on over car built &amp; delivered in Q2, despite many challenges!!"
12819,"These days, I mostly just play Polytopia, which comes free with every Tesla!"
12820,Dead Space was great
12821,Might work
12822,"Wow, years ago!"
12823,Sure. We can show them live. Eerily realistic. Maybe we should make a game.
12824,"When we need strange training examples, eg half a car on highway, Tesla sim delivers. Also, accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples. For safety tests, Autopilot sees dummy far away. Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers."
12825,But can I pay in Doge?
12826,"Yeah, its next-level &amp; will just keep getting better with more training data from fleet. Tesla sim team is also crushing it."
12827,But I guess I should take my own advice &amp; just work on saving the things I love
12828,"What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete, costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition."
12829,"Your company said the exact opposite in when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. In any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter."
12830,True
12831,Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
12832,Super Heavy on road &amp; th Tower segment added
12833,"Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. Aircraft, for example, have moved away from /A380 to , which has ~100 tons of payload."
12834,Million tons to Mars requires R R R
12835,Super Heavy moves tomorrow
12836,"Doubling diameter increases mass X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X. In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V."
12837,"Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, Baby Doge"
12838,What are we doing wrong at SpaceX? You probably have some good ideas. The fundamental optimization for making life multiplanetary &amp; backing up the biosphere is cost per ton to the surface of Mars. What system achieves that best?
12839,C
12840,Its like looking in a mirror
12841,Release the Doge!
12842,Stop gendering memes I mean mimes
12843,"Of course, you cant take that literally he meant the whole dairy industry"
12844,"Yeah, had great Poutine in Montreal. Does feel like your life expectancy is dropping in real-time as you eat it, but awesome nonetheless."
12845,"Sorry for any confusion. Dojo is a neural network training computer optimized for video (for self-driving). Unless there is a predictable pattern to hashing Scrypt (which we will not attempt to find), it will not be competitive with ASIC-based hashing. Potatoes are delicious!"
12846,"I do live in a $50k house, but not this specific one"
12847,"The economic prosperity that China has achieved is truly amazing, especially in infrastructure! I encourage people to visit and see for themselves."
12848,Impressive
12849,Then why were taxpayers forced to overpay for ULA?
12850,"Now, this sort of nonsense happens all the time with government contracts &amp; everyone knows it. However, in this case, it is money diverted from making life multiplanetary, which is the goal of SpaceX, vs the ULA goal of maximizing dividends to Lockheed &amp; Boeing. Not ok."
12851,"Yeah, but dogz rl"
12852,"ULA would be dead as a doornail without the two launch provider DoD requirement. If this is not true, then you wont have a problem removing it. Your parent company, Lockheed, darkened the skies with lobbyists to ensure F-35 was single source. Seems a little inconsistent"
12853,Yeah
12854,"Work needed between flights is less &amp; less, as shown by shortening time between reflights. Required work between flights for Starship &amp; Super Heavy is zero."
12855,You should notice several other improvements
12856,"Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R"
12857,"Weve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by ."
12858,"First one to fly will, so Booster . Booster will be used for ground tests. Were changing much of design from to . Booster was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships."
12859,"Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower."
12860,Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.
12861,"Actually, almost % liquid oxygen"
12862,"Should I bring a few spare engines I mean, just in case."
12863,Sure
12864,I liked your movie Hollywood Dirt!
12865,"There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too. That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July."
12866,When do the engines arrive?
12867,"Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the keep out zone, which is unreasonably gigantic. There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken."
12868,Sonic boom incoming
12869,"Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! Thats the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too. Retesting in a month or so with improved software. The improved software will then be uploaded to all cars with FSD computers."
12870,Not bad
12871,"Production release update coming this week, which includes raising max speed to mph. Sorry, mph limit was done as precautionary measure. Turned out to be unnecessary."
12872,Thanks for all the happy birthday wishes!
12873,Important to support
12874,"It is! Looks like we can get sec Isp with this version of Raptor Vacuum, so over sec with some improvements down the road."
12875,Cool
12876,"Schedule driver there is regulatory approval. Has to be certified for each aircraft type. Focusing on &amp; A320, as those serve most number of people, with development testing on Gulfstream."
12877,"All orbital planes activate in August, plus many other improvements, enabling global coverage, except for polar regions, which will take another months"
12878,Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of last night!
12879,"Sometimes people think it is performance, but safety is always the primary design requirement for a Tesla"
12880,One of my favorites quotes from a great human
12881,"Actually, a great many parts are produced by our suppliers, but Tesla is more vertically integrated than other carmakers"
12882,Bring back the Zune!! Its time.
12883,Starship Super Heavy
12884,True
12885,My Shiba Inu will be named Floki
12886,Timing is everything
12887,"Im driving alpha , but we need to fix some obvious issues before releasing beta , hopefully next week. FSD subscription capability should be turning on via the Tesla app."
12888,"It will be like this, but bigger"
12889,"For the Bitcurious? Very well then, lets do it"
12890,T is the new D
12891,I think about that quite a lot
12892,The comments in this thread are solid gold
12893,Lmfao omg
12894,"Nothing wrong with healthy competition, but this seems a little over-the-top. Would be cool if spacecraft could travel from one space station to another (which is much harder than it seems!)."
12895,"Basically, just a footnote"
12896,Edgy
12897,Thats not funny! Bitcoin maxis
12898,How many Bitcoin maxis does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
12899,Were almost done with first prototype booster. This will go to test stand A. Next one will fly to orbit. Team has been crushing it many days &amp; nights in a row!
12900,Oh right Bitcoin haha
12901,Bicurious?
12902,That is an exciting goal!
12903,"Cool, but an unnecessary complication for now. These are being removed to speed up time to orbital launch."
12904,Wow!
12905,At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference.
12906,Shout out to the awesome Tesla global team. Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful!
12907,"Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate."
12908,This is an important improvement
12909,Very sorry to hear that. Condolences to JB and his family.
12910,Tesla financing round closed at pm Dec th last hour of last day possible or payroll wouldve bounced days later. I gave Tesla last of my remaining cash from PayPal. Didnt even own a house or anything sellable.
12911,"Looking at holding Tesla AI Day in about a month or so. Will go over progress with Tesla AI software &amp; hardware, both training &amp; inference. Purpose is recruiting."
12912,physical-world sigh
12913,Happy Fathers Day!
12914,Yeah
12915,Nice work
12916,Haha pretty much
12917,This is epic. Very impressive history.
12918,True
12919,"Peak acceleration is over gs, which is % faster than falling"
12920,Haha
12921,Real pic of ships next to Starbase Tiki Bar on right
12922,True
12923,Steam engines are even better!
12924,Ive been driving with the yoke for a while &amp; its great imo. Progressive steering would require complex gearing or drive-by-wire without direct mechanical link. Will aim for that in a few years.
12925,"Congratulations, this is a great achievement!"
12926,We might use SN16 on a hypersonic flight test
12927,Fair enough
12928,Based on what data?
12929,Cool
12930,"Hello, Im Clark Kent"
12931,Manufacturing is so hard. I have the utmost respect for those who build things.
12932,It is an honor to work with such talented engineers
12933,Lets just skip original video games &amp; movies &amp; go straight to the sequel
12934,Massive increase in Supercharger network is underway
12935,I love carbs
12936,Pretty much an average day back then
12937,Nice
12938,Maybe we should advertise informationally just so people know stuff like this exists
12939,Most people have no idea just how good the Tesla air purification system is. Literally X better than any other car.
12940,"Oh man, home hvac that is super energy efficient, quiet &amp; purifies the air would be great. We developed it for the car, but it can be scaled up for home use."
12941,New HVAC firmware coming soon that will make it quieter
12942,"True, we somewhat overcompensated on Bluetooth antenna capability haha. Will work on turning it down near your destination."
12943,From the top of Starbase high bay
12944,Stacking Super Heavy Aft Section
12945,T H4X0R got my phone. Nuthin I could do. Sorry babe.

12952,Decided to sell my last remaining house. Just needs to go to a large family who will live there. Its a special place.
12953,"After several successful launches, land overflight earlier in trajectory passes E-sub-c safety threshold. That said, Starship will also launch from Cape long-term."
12954,So much more is needed for life to become multiplanetary
12955,This is true
12956,Our Soul Dichotomy
12957,"This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market. When theres confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions."
12958,The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets! We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead!
12959,"Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."
12960,Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation. Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator.

12969,Most amount of fun on wheels! Pure joy on tap whenever u want.
12970,Order Tesla Model S Plaid at
12971,Haha
12972,I love the yoke!
12973,Tesla engineering is awesome!
12974,People like it!
12975,Starlink missions will move to Starship
12976,Useful mass to orbit is the primary figure of merit
12977,Exactly
12978,"Now that I have made some improvements, Im pretty sure its worth $69k haha"
12979,"My primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. Its kinda awesome though. Only house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day."
12980,"Yeah, sold my houses, except for in Bay Area thats rented out for events. Working on sustainable energy for Earth with Tesla &amp; protecting future of consciousness by making life multiplanetary with SpaceX. Also, AI risk mitigation with Neuralink &amp; fixing traffic with Boring."
12981,"Exactly. Only time I sell Tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring &amp; I have no choice. Btw, I will continue to pay income taxes in California proportionate to my time in state, which is &amp; will be significant."
12982,"Not even a good fake anonymous The article is behind a paywall, and it looks like Anonymous hacking skills are not enough to get behind it"
12983,Tesla Europe team is doing great!
12984,Just donated
12985,"Well said, Dave!"
12986,The long-term strength of Tesla will be manufacturing technology
12987,"Wow, thanks!"
12988,Thanks Lloyd!
12989,A new space race has begun!
12990,At the annual shareholder meeting! Probably late July / early August.
12991,to mph in under secs. Quickest production car ever made of any kind. Has to be felt to be believed.
12992,"Plaid+ is canceled. No need, as Plaid is just so good."
12993,Model S goes to Plaid speed this week
12994,VIC-20 with KB memory
12995,"Some engineers I worked with went on to help create WoW, but it was too addicting. Couldnt afford the time (sigh)."
12996,"Tbh, I was into PC &amp; still into PC"
12997,"One more production release of pure vision this week, then FSD beta a week or two later. V9.0 FSD is also pure vision. Foundational improvements are immense."
12998,Maybe
12999,I do like to cause a little mischief
13000,He will perhaps have a baby soon
13001,The operating costs of a Tesla are also much lower than a gasoline cruiser!
13002,I guess we read the instructions haha
13003,"Dont kill what you hate, Save what you love"
13004,Fair point. Back to regularly scheduled programming.
13005,Haha awesome

13016,Needs laser eyes too
13017,Yup
13018,"Thanks Seriously, it was so insane! Fud still happening a little, but doesnt resonate when enough people have the product."
13019,Some quarks &amp; a lepton walk into a bar
13020,Things get weird at the driver level
13021,"Thats where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range). Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs &amp; mid range cars."
13022,We went public for $3.40/share!
13023,Science-fiction should not be fiction forever!
13024,Might take a few kicks at the can before we catch the rocket haha
13025,"Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it. Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale. That said, its obv not a long-term issue."
13026,Found this pic of me as a child
13027,Sigh
13028,When I visit Japan later this year
13029,Baby Shark crushes all! More views than humans.
13030,Sounds kinda fun
13031,OG Smartwatch
13032,"Yeah, new Model S &amp; X have PS5 level entertainment computing power"
13033,Nice
13034,Agreed
13035,"Making this work has been / still is super difficult, but its a revolution in car body design &amp; production lighter, tighter, better NVH, higher precision, lower capex, lower unit cost"
13036,Moving lumbar was removed only in front passenger seat of /Y (obv not there in rear seats). Logs showed almost no usage. Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used. Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide. Raw materials especially.
13037,"Pretty close. Inner ring is closer to center , as all gimbal together. Boost back burn efficiency is greatly improved in this config."
13038,Ocean spaceport Deimos is under construction for launch next year
13039,Sehnsucht
13040,Danke!!
13041,"Actually, so-called secondary structure is the hard part so many pipes &amp; wires. Tall stuff &amp; small stuff are the toughest things about Starship."
13042,True
13043,M years is only ~6% increase in age of Earth
13044,Raptor production is approaching one every hours
13045,"Raptors on Booster initially, rising to later this year, along with thrust increase per engine. Aiming for &gt;7500 ton thrust long-term. T/W ~1.5."
13046,Great idea
13047,Dark Helmet emotes Plaid well
13048,Actually true haha
13049,"Basically, our entire product roadmap is from Spaceballs"
13050,Yes
13051,Congrats Boring Company team!
13052,"Sick burn haha. Hopefully, next year."
13053,Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June . Needs one more week of tweak. This car feels like a spaceship. Words cannot describe the limbic resonance.
13054,Vegas FTW!
13055,Exactly. Atmospheric drag clearing out orbital debris is a major reason why we dropped altitude to ~550km.
13056,I suspect that name made him strong
13057,"For the low, low price of ?"
13058,"Ship &amp; Booster , Starbase Highbay"
13059,"Tesla sure would appreciate changing the law, so that this is not required!"
13060,Exactly
13061,"Potentially, times higher"
13062,Pretty close. No tiles on back side of flaps. Some tiles towards leeward side of ship trailing plasma spilling off rear of flaps.
13063,Cumulative payload to orbit is the really crazy number. Falcon has delivered more than double rest of world combined over trailing months.
13064,"If only they had spaceships, theyd still be around"
13065,Deep thots
13066,"Not sure who wrote this, but its accurate"
13067,Yup
13068,Aiming to have hot gas thrusters on booster for first orbital flight
13069,"They are now the same (LOX below CH4). Ox is times heavier than fuel, so makes sense to have it lower."
13070,"Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in weeks, then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time."
13071,Exactly
13072,Lot of plumbing!
13073,"Please note Dogecoin has no formal organization &amp; no one reports to me, so my ability to take action is limited"
13074,"Doge has dogs &amp; memes, whereas the others do not"
13075,They told me they would appreciate help
13076,"Someone suggested changing Dogecoin fees based on phases of the moon, which is pretty awesome haha"
13077,"If youd like to help develop Doge, please submit ideas on GitHub &amp;"
13078,Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current &amp; planned renewable usage &amp; to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.

13080,Congrats!
13081,"Becoming multiplanetary is one of the greatest filters. Only now, billion years after Earth formed, is it possible. How long this window to reach Mars remains open is uncertain. Perhaps a long time, perhaps not. In case it is the latter, we should act now."
13082,The hard part about Raptor is simplifying it
13083,"The true battle is between fiat &amp; crypto. On balance, I support the latter."
13084,Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology
13085,Welcome to the future. Its gonna be great.
13086,Congrats!
13087,Wow!
13088,This will actually be able to fly very briefly. I always laughed at flying cars &amp; now making one. Fate irony haha.
13089,"We cant wait to build this crazy truck! Its a total rethink of vehicle mechanical architecture &amp; production methods, so super hard project, but worthwhile in the end."
13090,"Achieving truly decentralized finance power to the people is a noble &amp; important goal. Layer count depends on projected bandwidth &amp; compute, both rising rapidly, which means single layer network can carry all human transactions in future imo. For now, Lightning is needed."
13091,"Ideally kWh, calculated as total energy used by system divided by max transaction rate"
13092,"Yes, with the SpaceX rocket thruster option package. It will be safe, but very intense. Probably not wise for those with a medical condition same as a hardcore roller coaster."
13093,Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
13094,"I agree that this *can* be done over time, but recent extreme energy usage growth could not possibly have been done so fast with renewables. This question is easily resolved if the top hashing orgs just post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not."
13095,"Yeah, I havent &amp; wont sell any Doge"
13096,A longtime Tesla supporter gave me the Doge dollar sticker at Giga Berlin
13097,"Oh sorry, yes, Roadster will have thrusters, not Plaid. Plaid is indeed close to the theoretical maximum of a roadworthy car without special devices."
13098,"It will have high pressure air rocket thrusters behind a license plate that flips down. Bong, James Bong"
13099,Good idea
13100,Sure
13101,Worth reading
13102,"Currency is already digital! Decentralized crypto is an attempt to wrest power of currency dilution (pernicious form of taxation) &amp; capital controls from governments. That said, I sure hope the cure is better than the disease! Mars/AI are essential to passing the great filter/s."

13105,"Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage, which is its most compelling use."
13106,How much is that Doge in the window?
13107,Tesla Model S Plaid delivery event June at our California factory Fastest production car ever to mph in under secs
13108,This is how I imagine most theaters are these days haha
13109,Congrats to on embracing an electric future!
13110,Production article will look different (better)
13111,Likewise. I have attention *surplus* disorder haha.
13112,I would like to second that congratulations. Outstanding accomplishment by China!

13115,Ferragu is remarkably insightful
13116,"Great progress so far! Thank you for the support from Brandenburg. I would also like to express appreciation for the permit authorities, as I know this is a large and complex project. When all the finishing touches are done, I hope it will be considered a jewel of Brandenburg!"
13117,"Aiming for extreme precision with next gen Model Y microns, not millimeters"
13118,Giga Berlin suppliers please accelerate!
13119,"I worked for Peter Nicholson, who is awesome. Mostly, we exchanged math riddles, although I did figure out a multi-billion dollar arbitrage opportunity for the bank. Figured theyd at least give me $1/hour raise, but no"
13120,Going through all aspects of next gen Model Y production system with team. Lot of talented people at Giga Berlin. This place will rock!
13121,Hallelujah
13122,"To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin"
13123,Indeed
13124,"Hey cryptocurrency experts, ever heard of PayPal? Its possible maybe that I know than you realize about how money works."
13125,"Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies. A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded, almost killing miners, and Bitcoin hash rate dropped %. Sound decentralized to you?"

13128,Obnoxious threads like this make me want to go all in on Doge
13129,Coming soon. Sorry for the delay!
13130,"For those bad at math , X higher transaction volume with X lower fees means total fees earned stay same. Low fees &amp; high volume are needed to become currency of Earth."
13131,My understanding is that the big accounts are exchanges. Would be good to confirm though. Am told the biggest one is Robinhood.
13132,Only if Doge cant do it. Big pain in the neck to create another one.
13133,Congratulations!! Mars is very difficult.
13134,"Ideally, Doge speeds up block time X, increases block size X &amp; drops fee X. Then it wins hands down."
13135,"Yes, hardware-in-the-loop testing of software is essential"
13136,"We need to make sure ship wont break up on reentry, hence deorbit over Pacific"
13137,/4 of the way around the Earth
13138,As always
13139,Locating ground stations at data centers will significantly improve latency &amp; jitter. Data can go from user terminal to server without touching the Internet.
13140,Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.
13141,I have a lot of respect for anyone who ships useful product at scale. It is insanely hard work.
13142,"To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it cant drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal"
13143,It is high time there was a carbon tax!
13144,Energy usage trend over past few months is insane
13145,Tesla &amp; Bitcoin
13146,Haha
13147,Subscription rolls out in about a month
13148,"I think were maybe a month or two away from wide beta. But these things are hard to predict accurately. The work we had to do for pure vision driving was needed for FSD, so much more progress has been made than it would seem."
13149,"End of year, along with FSD, provided we get regulatory approval. Smart Summon is just a subset of FSD."
13150,Yes
13151,We had to focus on removing radar &amp; confirming safety. That release goes out next week to US production. Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD &amp; v9 beta will release. Difference between v8 &amp; v9 is gigantic.
13152,Geil!

13208,Exactly!
13209,Was using this in my car last night
13210,FSD display V9.0 will show actual probability distribution of objects true minds eye of the neural net. This is so cool!
13211,I swear Canada FSD beta will be as soon as humanly possible!
13212,True. Anyone paying attention to the rate of improvement will realize that Tesla Autopilot/FSD is already superhuman for highway driving &amp; swiftly getting there for city streets.
13213,"Hopefully, later this year for several more states. Insurance is different for almost every state in America &amp; regulatory approvals take time."
13214,And hopefully EU this summer
13215,Probably a few months. There are many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada driving.
13216,Gating factor is achieving &amp; proving higher safety with pure vision than with vision+radar. We are almost there. FSD Beta V9.0 will blow your mind.
13217,Probably two weeks
13218,Good technical analysis
13219,Yes
13220,Sorry

13232,"FCC is fair &amp; sensible. NHTSA &amp; FAA too. % of the time, I agree with regulators! On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didnt anticipate."
13233,"Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion, Tesla focuses on the product. I trust the people."
13234,Yes
13235,Yup
13236,"I find it more helpful to read/follow individual journalists, rather than publications. Any given publication is going to have wide range of views, albeit vast majority of stories about any subject are negative, perhaps reflecting innate human biases. Citizen journalism FTW!"
13237,"Starship SN15 static fire completed, preparing for flight later this week"

13243,"Yeah, roughly MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels. Whats really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks!"
13244,"An advantage I did have is that my father is a talented electrical &amp; mechanical engineer, so I was taught a lot engineering (without appreciating it at the time)"
13245,True. The opposite in fact I provide financial support to my parents.
13246,We just got approval to open a new Supercharger station in Malibu!
13247,So awesome!
13248,Lets find out just how live Saturday Night Live really is
13249,Am hosting SNL on May
13250,Yup
13251,Lies can be beautiful
13252,define beauty
13253,What does the future hodl?
13254,Absolutely!
13255,This is the essence of my philosophy
13256,This is important
13257,Yup
13258,mins to launch
13259,Astronauts preparing to launch to
13260,Yeah
13261,Haha true
13262,Happy Earth Day
13263,Haha
13264,"Im staying at a friends place in Florida that is % powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall. When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights dont even flicker. Owner says he doesnt notice."
13265,Does seem a little weird
13266,"If Tesla owners are conspiracy theorists, then it would be fair to call them advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers. If thats an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is ~0.02% of deaths"
13267,Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility
13268,True
13269,"Very important. Most people dont know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries."
13270,"Newest units can probably do as much as kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at C ambient temp. In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc."
13271,"Powerwall peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at C ambient temp."
13272,"Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts."
13273,"Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery"
13274,"Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables /7 electricity security for your home. Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid."
13275,Sandy Munro knows what hes talking about
13276,cgi irl!
13277,"I could get a job, just not at an Internet company (werent many back then)"
13278,Haha true
13279,New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space
13280,NHTSA is great
13281,Hell of a coincidence haha
13282,Exactly
13283,Awesome!
13284,"Your research as a private individual is better than professionals ! Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD. Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have."
13285,Support for humanitys future in space is super appreciated. Lets make the sci-fi future we want real!
13286,Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas
13287,"Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. Doesnt mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer."
13288,Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching times lower chance of accident than average vehicle
13289,Dragon spacecraft &amp; Falcon rocket
13290,Great progress by Tesla team
13291,"If we make life multiplanetary, there may come a day when some plants &amp; animals die out on Earth, but are still alive on Mars"
13292,Great review! Neuralink is open to working with neuroscientists to advance the field. Short-term goal is addressing brain &amp; spine problems. Ultimate goal is symbiosis of human &amp; machine intelligence.
13293,Everything to the moon!
13294,We are honored to be part of the team
13295,NASA Rules!!
13296,Austin Rocks!!
13297,Same with Berlin
13298,"Limited production of Model Y this year, high volume next year"
13299,"I was just there, driving Cybertruck around the site where it will be built!"
13300,Make life multiplanetary!
13301,"Yeah, should be fully mobile later this year, so you can move it anywhere or use it on an RV or truck in motion. We need a few more satellite launches to achieve compete coverage &amp; some key software upgrades."
13302,"This is accurate. Service uptime, bandwidth &amp; latency are improving rapidly. Probably out of beta this summer."
13303,One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary!
13304,Aiming to launch next week
13305,Certainly one of the largest. A company whose name rhymes with Shmoogle is pretty far ahead. But I think were the leader in shallow-minded AI haha!
13306,Doge Barking at the Moon
13307,Doge Barking at the Moon Miro
13308,"While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software. Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, its hopeless. This is insanely hard."
13309,Le Petit Prince
13310,Soon it will be real
13311,"Actually, yes. And Red Rocket truck stop."
13312,Stop In the Name of Love!
13313,I found some footage of the drive
13314,Insanely cute!
13315,"Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes, but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing."
13316,Hopefully addressed this summer
13317,Same timing
13318,Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month. This is a march of s trying to get probability of no injury above % of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving.
13319,Will investigate
13320,Probably late July
13321,Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Making excellent progress solving real-world AI.
13322,th Raptor engine coming soon
13323,Maybe its about how you use it
13324,Getting there
13325,"That version of Falcon never flew, so must be ~2004. The CAD looks so simple! I think we were still using SolidWorks back then."
13326,"Yeah, not scalable. My grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level."
13327,That was my night job. Day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research.
13328,"True. Ancient times Had to flip CPU registers explicitly, as computer was so slow."
13329,Absolutely
13330,"Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their approved collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing."
13331,For now. Costs are decreasing rapidly.
13332,Love this beautiful shot
13333,Trust the shrub
13334,The art In Cyberpunk is incredible
13335,Nope haha
13336,"If you dont say anything &amp; engage Autopilot, it will soon guess based on time of day, taking you home or to work or to whats on your calendar"
13337,That rocket is a hardcore veteran of many missions
13338,Blimps rock
13339,"Due to lower gravity, you can travel from surface of Mars to surface of Earth fairly easily with a single stage rocket. Earth to Mars is vastly harder."
13340,Good thread
13341,Pretty much
13342,These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.
13343,"Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind."
13344,"When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion."
13345,This is a major problem!
13346,Just needs some legs
13347,The Starship launch tower that catches the giant rocket booster is basically Mechazilla
13348,But wait how is the core of the earth lit by the sun? Stop asking questions!!
13349,Kong vs Godzilla has record for most meth ever consumed in a writers room
13350,going to moon very soon
13351,Actually happened to me in Cyberpunk haha
13352,Pretty much
13353,Where is Shrek !?
13354,"Good point. Next major software rev will do much better with automating wipers, seat heating &amp; defrost. Probable seat settings just based on occupant mass distribution should be possible."
13355,Yup
13356,Turns out love video games &amp; snacks just like us!
13357,Its all about the cufflinks
13358,I feel like this sometimes
13359,It will
13360,Remove
13361,Simulation is improving rendering resolution
13362,Congrats to NIO. That is a tough milestone.
13363,"Almost ready with FSD Beta V9.0. Step change improvement is massive, especially for weird corner cases &amp; bad weather. Pure vision, no radar."
13364,Thanks to all that helped SpaceX!
13365,Just read it. Book is accurate.
13366,Yeah
13367,Pretty much
13368,Soon our monkey will be on twitch &amp; discord haha
13369,Good piece!
13370,Comes with wireless charging baseball cap
13371,Pretty much Great episode!
13372,A monkey is literally playing a video game telepathically using a brain chip!!
13373,Yes
13374,"The device is implanted flush with skull &amp; charges wirelessly, so you look &amp; feel totally normal"
13375,"Absolutely doable. Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version , highly likely by version ."
13376,"Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again"
13377,Yes
13378,First product will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs
13379,"Hopefully, later this year"
13380,Sure
13381,Monkey plays Pong with his mind
13382,Looking at pups soon!
13383,"Shock absorption is built into tower arms. Since tower is ground side, it can use a lot more mass to arrest booster downward momentum."
13384,Load points just below the grid fins
13385,Just one skyscraper catching another nbd haha
13386,Thanks Tesla suppliers for providing us with critical parts!
13387,A tidal wave of vaccine is being produced!
13388,"Probably J&amp;J, but BioNtech &amp; Moderna are good too. Some debate imo as to whether a second synthetic mRNA shot is really needed, but the first is a no-brainer."
13389,Latter
13390,"To be clear, I do support vaccines in general &amp; covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal. In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen."
13391,Needs legs for moon &amp; Mars
13392,Global payload to orbit is the key metric
13393,Nice
13394,"Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal glide with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs)."
13395,"Starship booster, largest flying object ever designed, will be caught out of sky by launch tower. Big step forward, as reflight can be done in under an hour."
13396,"Well-written and fair, much like his articles on space"
13397,Coming soon. Crazy number of launches this year!
13398,They will be recovered from the water &amp; reused
13399,Tanks for the memery! Panzer of the Lake
13400,What do you think of the unusually high ratio of S&amp market cap to GDP?
13401,"Some kind of ELO level, updated once or twice a year based on what someone actually got done, might be most effective. Important that it go both up *and* down."
13402,New &amp; improved version!
13403,Special mention of Tesla China
13404,Obv
13405,Great work by Tesla team!
13406,Nice
13407,"The Earth is not flat, its a hollow globe &amp; Donkey King lives there!"
13408,Those two really could have come in handy for the stuck ship!
13409,Last Kingdom vs Vikings
13410,"Ascent phase, transition to horizontal &amp; control during free fall were good. A (relatively) small CH4 leak led to fire on engine &amp; fried part of avionics, causing hard start attempting landing burn in CH4 turbopump. This is getting fixed ways to Sunday."
13411,Godzilla vs Kong is so amaze much wow! Most insane movie Ive ever seen! Love letter to conspiracy theorists! And yet heartwarming in the end.
13412,The Starships feast in Valhalla!
13413,One of the greatest things Ive ever seen
13414,Ich habe ein Semester Deutsch an der Universitt studiert usw
13415,Haha Falcon? Nein!
13416,"I recommend propulsive landing, as that is extensible to planets, moons &amp; asteroids. Wings &amp; runways are limited to Earth."
13417,"For practical purposes, there is no limit. It will just get increasingly difficult to service."
13418,"This a good path, but I recommend aiming for full reusability"
13419,Urgent need to build more housing in greater Austin area!
13420,Austin++
13421,No it doesnt hurt at all
13422,True
13423,I fried a lot of neurons on that problem!
13424,Me in my sick new car (left him the money)
13425,"Had no money to invest in Zip2, but my founder equity yielded ~$15M after tax. Of that, I rolled ~$10M into PayPal, which yielded ~$180M, then Basic principle is that I would not ask investors to risk money on my company if I would not also do so."
13426,Major new Supercharger station coming to Santa Monica soon! Hoping to have s diner &amp; best movie clips playing too. Thanks Santa Monica city!
13427,"After all, SpaceXs first payload to orbit &amp; back was a wheel of cheese"
13428,Glad you enjoyed the experience!
13429,SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon
13430,Nicheman his superpower is appealing to small audiences
13431,True
13432,Over people are needed for Giga Texas just through ! - mins from airport mins from downtown - Right on Colorado river
13433,Can be a little foggy sometimes
13434,Barely a scratch. Back on the stand soon! Will report conclusions as soon as we know them.
13435,Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two
13436,I sure hope so!
13437,"Agreed! Were not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. Were also aiming to increase solar power from MW to MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power."
13438,Probably most in space you could possibly feel by being in a glass dome
13439,Am donating $20M to Cameron County schools &amp; $10M to City of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. Details to follow next week.
13440,"BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2. Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky."
13441,"Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so! SpaceXs hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly."
13442,More like V10.0
13443,"Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high. However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach entry heating &amp; land intact."
13444,"SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine. Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days."
13445,"Looks like engine had issues on ascent &amp; didnt reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasnt needed. Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today."
13446,At least the crater is in the right place!
13447,A high production rate solves many ills
13448,"Demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year."
13449,Tracking to a potential am liftoff
13450,"That would be great, or possibly via video with full access to telemetry"
13451,FAA inspector unable to reach Starbase in time for launch today. Postponed to no earlier than tomorrow.
13452,Possible Starship flight tomorrow afternoon
13453,Trying
13454,Who is
13455,Nice
13456,Wholesome memes
13457,We should be laughing our asses off if its so damn smart!
13458,I wanna know when AI will be able to do standup comedy well!?
13459,Sounds about right
13460,"Its not really possible to match the human brain in for any amount of money imo, but it will be possible probably in a few years"
13461,"This is crazy. Should use Tesla Megapacks for load-leveling the grid. More effective, more reliable and costs less."
13462,Haha actually true
13463,Check out our new crane
13464,This appears to be widespread. I wonder who is doing it
13465,"We are too cell-constrained right now, but probably ok next year"
13466,Great video
13467,Standing down SN11 until probably Monday. Additional checkouts are needed. Doing our best to land &amp; fully recover.
13468,Haha
13469,"Heavy comes in more like a javelin. Similar to Falcon , but caught by the tower vs landing on legs."
13470,I think there is a &gt;0% chance Tesla could be the biggest company
13471,Solar has come a long way. Now just needs lots of long-life batteries!
13472,"Shame on you, Onion. This is why people are switching to !"
13473,/2 My father &amp; his extended family have been dependent on financial support from my brother &amp; me for over years. This article is actually accurate:
13474,"/2 This article is false. - I arrived by myself in Canada in with ~CA$2500 - Paid my own way through college, ending with ~$100k student debt - Started st company with no funding &amp; just one computer I built - Theres no evidence whatsoever of an emerald mine"
13475,There will be no handles
13476,"If theres ever a scandal about me, *please* call it Elongate"
13477,This comment thread is
13478,Dont defy DeFi
13479,Mars rover looking back
13480,Fair point
13481,You raise a good point haha
13482,"Wow, shame on ZDF Info!"
13483,Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year
13484,"Tesla is using only internal &amp; open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly. Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency."
13485,You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin
13486,Yup
13487,And books haha
13488,You can basically learn anything on YouTube/Reddit
13489,SpaceX will be landing Starships on Mars well before . The really hard threshold is making Mars Base Alpha self-sustaining.
13490,He was great on many levels
13491,Strongest argument against aliens
13492,I once did a road trip across most of US with adults &amp; kids in a Model S!
13493,They are aiming too low. Only rockets that are fully &amp; rapidly reusable will be competitive. Everything else will seem like a cloth biplane in the age of jets.
13494,The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve -60mph in under secs &amp; it has four doors &amp; seats up to people.
13495,"SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary full &amp; rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth. Starlinks purpose is to provide Internet to the least served &amp; to pay for Mars."
13496,Going well. Lot of work for an extra secs of Isp!
13497,Hopefully will happen this decade
13498,True
13499,I am accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary &amp; extend the light of consciousness to the stars
13500,"When vast amounts of manufacturing are needed, as in robotaxis, this slows down rate of introduction, so maybe more like winner-takes-a-quarter. Still great."
13501,"Not trying to roast, just being as literal as possible"
13502,"Yeah, but Im English"
13503,"Not quite how I would tell the story, but its probably worth a read"
13504,This is important
13505,"Wow, hard to believe that was years ago!"
13506,Sigh
13507,I actually ate the sandwich haha!
13508,Music in zero gravity
13509,"Given significant architectural changes, including fundamental improvements to pure vision, there is limited value to testing .x. Hoping to upload V9.0 &amp; button next month."

13511,The [ahem] reach-around
13512,"We could talk about Life, the Universe and Everything"
13513,Coming soon!
13514,"As you can see, I have a long history with using tents!"
13515,What would you like to talk about?
13516,"Floor is installed, elevator is operational, waiting on glass"
13517,The high bay is measured to fit!
13518,We will need launch tower for that. Hook height for the lift is ~140 m &amp; both booster &amp; ship need to be stabilized at stage separation joint.
13519,"Yes, Booster is a production pathfinder, figuring out how to build &amp; transport meter tall stage. Booster will fly."
13520,First Super Heavy Booster
13521,Sometimes its about Doge

13533,I love music. It makes my heart sing.
13534,This is good
13535,Play your favorite song in a Tesla &amp; turn the volume to You will see. You will feel.

13552,Yes
13553,For sure wise for elderly or immunocompromised to take the vaccine. Some debate about the second jab though. Quite a few negative reactions to that.
13554,FSD Beta has now been expanded to ~2000 owners &amp; weve also revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road. No accidents to date. Next significant release will be in April. Going with pure vision not even using radar. This is the way to real-world AI.
13555,Absolutely

13560,Dieses Jahr
13561,Transparent aluminum (ALON) might be cool
13562,Celebrating a year of great work by the SpaceX team!
13563,Wow!
13564,"Like , but *with* self-driving haha"
13565,"If manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon. A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars."
13566,Yes
13567,"Falcon is almost always at max capacity. When it has spare performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship. Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world."
13568,"Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd."
13569,"I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon."
13570,"Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so its not a gamechanger."
13571,"Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster"
13572,Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
13573,"There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. Something similar happened on an early Falcon flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff."
13574,"Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time."
13575,SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.
13576,We will ask the regulators
13577,"Build of FSD should be done QA testing by end of next week, so thats roughly when download button should show up"
13578,"Assuming user approves warning &amp; agrees to drive carefully, it will download latest QA-tested FSD Beta build as soon as car connects to wifi"
13579,Delamain AI cabs should be able to drive themselves when youre in them &amp; be electric by
13580,it until you make it
13581,"Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp; RVs."
13582,"Starbase, Texas"
13583,Its all hot air in the end haha
13584,"Still many fine details to address, but the final product will be fantastic. Theres nothing else even close."
13585,"Haha true. Yet, still, so much dignity is ascribed to horses!"
13586,Carnot efficiency of the Universe?
13587,"Ultimately, yes"
13588,"Great band, too bad they broke up"
13589,"Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built."
13590,"The $1400 is mostly good imo (UBI lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise)."
13591,"Should be very soon. Many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada roads, so harder than it seems."
13592,"The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 . cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not ordered as an option."
13593,Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing. Note: word Beta is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams.
13594,"Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding Download Beta button to Service section of car display in ~10 days"
13595,Doge spelled backwards is Egod
13596,Beta V8.3 has literally ~1000 improvements. Will take time to QA internally before release probably in two or three weeks.
13597,This was way past leg loads. They got squashed hard.
13598,"If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know. Doubling beta program size now with &amp; probably X size with . Still be careful, but its getting mature."
13599,Starhopper is an old timer who has seen a lot of things!
13600,"Thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. Weve never seen this before. Next time, min two engines all the way to the ground &amp; restart engine if engine or have issues."
13601,Was super fun tbh haha
13602,Or is this just fantasy?
13603,SN10 is in Valhalla now
13604,Cybervikings of Mars
13605,"Tesla AI, both hardware &amp; software, is deeply underestimated"
13606,"Tesla &amp; Ford are the only American carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of s of car startups. Prototypes are easy, production is hard &amp; being cash flow positive is excruciating."
13607,cgi irl
13608,"SpaceX team is doing great work! One day, the true measure of success will be that Starship flights are commonplace."
13609,"RIP SN10, honorable discharge"
13610,Starship SN10 landed in one piece!
13611,Launch abort on slightly conservative high thrust limit. Increasing thrust limit &amp; recycling propellant for another flight attempt today.
13612,mins to Starship test flight attempt
13613,March rd
13614,Starship launch tomorrow. Window opens at am.
13615,"Yes, beta will be offered much more widely when version is done, hopefully next month"
13616,FSD beta build V8.1 normally drives me around with no interventions. Next version is a big step change beyond that. Tesla is solving a major part of real-world AI. This is not widely known.
13617,Youre welcome
13618,Good point
13619,"Ok, lets figure this out tomorrow. Im all for exciting video coverage, but we also cant have the place festooned with cameras."
13620,First Ive heard of this. Well fix the situation. Im a fan of video!
13621,Indeed it was
13622,"Sounds about right, but we want to be very careful with this transition period"
13623,"There was still a surprisingly high usage of horses in , but the trend was obvious"
13624,Space
13625,"From thence to Mars, And hence the Stars."
13626,An area much larger than Boca Chica
13627,Very much so &amp; its leader shall be The Doge
13628,"Creating the city of Starbase, Texas"
13629,Cool
13630,Yup
13631,Horses are even self-driving!
13632,Scammers &amp; crypto should get a room
13633,: Dogecoin is dumb
13634,"Note, buying FSD will still be a better long-term deal than subscription"
13635,Q2 for sure
13636,Green eggs &amp; SPAC
13637,"Looks familiar haha. Nonetheless, the right move. Congrats to Rocket Lab."
13638,Tesla China team rocks!
13639,Doge meme shield (legendary item)
13640,New drug coming out called Regretamine. Pop one &amp; all regrets are gone.
13641,Always wondered where exactly your gaming character keeps all the stuff
13642,Ahem
13643,Do androids dream of electric cars?
13644,Nothing if not discreet
13645,Hey babe
13646,"We will use a catapult &amp; air mattresses to land on the roof, then base jump off"
13647,Nickel is our biggest concern for scaling lithium-ion cell production. Thats why we are shifting standard range cars to an iron cathode. Plenty of iron (and lithium)!
13648,Absolutely
13649,Fremont shut down for two days (parts shortages) &amp; restarted yesterday
13650,"This is not about winning anyone over. We are production-limited. The reason we are making our own cells is to *supplement* max production of suppliers. Even moving at full speed, they cannot build enough cells."
13651,I hope they do! It would be awesome
13652,"Prices in the US (of all goods) dont include VAT, but its usually included in other countries. Then theres import duty &amp; transport costs. The intent is that revenue to Tesla is roughly similar in all countries, so taxes, tariffs &amp; transport make up the difference."
13653,mm of full hard or Stainless is bulletproof to a mm or .45
13654,"Not a meta4, I mean actual books"
13655,Both
13656,I admit to judging books by their cover
13657,Starship to the moon
13658,Sounds like a good idea
13659,"Out on launch pad, engine swap underway"
13660,"Probably mid year, but Starlink is really meant for those who are least served. Bay usually has great Internet."
13661,You might see much higher download speeds on Starlink at times. Testing system upgrades.
13662,Rockets are ridiculously hard (sigh)
13663,I love dogs &amp; memes
13664,On the actual moon
13665,Literally
13666,Potentially
13667,"Many steps forward, some steps back. Yes, we do a lot of QA before releasing a beta version."
13668,They will fly there from our launch site. Stationed around the world.
13669,Seems likely
13670,"Were upgrading all NNs to surround video, using subnets on focal areas (vs equal compute on all uncropped pixels) &amp; many other things, so more time needed to write &amp; validate software. Maybe something next week. This is evolving into solving a big part of physical world AI."
13671,Interesting
13672,One of them may be in limited operation by end of year
13673,"One of the engines is suspect, so were swapping it out"
13674,"Short-term, CH4 delivered &amp; O2 produced. Propellant is ~78% O2. Long-term, Sabatier reaction to convert CO2 + H2O -&gt; CH4 + O2 using wind &amp; solar power."
13675,Just a Surface Detail
13676,I hope we dont go bankrupt building them!
13677,Excession
13678,Super cool
13679,We have too much product complexity already
13680,Tunnels!!
13681,"Hopefully, later this year"
13682,Later this year
13683,"It is still available off menu, but I dont think the range, in many drive conditions, yet meets the Tesla standard of excellence"
13684,"The Tesla Solar Roof is slightly hydrophobic, so water, snow or ice slide off easily"
13685,Final design is looking Was just in the studio
13686,"Most of Earth by end of year, all by next year, then its about densifying coverage. Important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban areas. Satellites are best for low to medium population density areas."
13687,Speed will double to ~300Mb/s &amp; latency will drop to ~20ms later this year
13688,Of spaceflight
13689,Hypernominalization
13690,Dojo Doge
13691,Good chance of flying this week!
13692,Should we?
13693,Why dont we have these already!?
13694,Cryptocurrency explained
13695,Or did they say pegged to the dollar? Something like that
13696,Heard a rumor some crypto coin was pegging the dollar
13697,Machine learning is so amaze!
13698,"Just some used Antminer L3+ rigs bought off eBay. Not really economic, but it was a fun family project."
13699,"Most people have no idea, even though there are so many FSD progress videos posted. Munro understood right away. There will be a gap before the next release, but then it will be a step change better. Tesla is solving a major real-world AI problem."
13700,I just set up some little Doge mining rigs with my kids. It was fun.
13701,"That said, BTC &amp; ETH do seem high lol"
13702,"An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto. Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter. That data, like all data, is subject to latency &amp; error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both."
13703,Avocado Toast
13704,I just want to start a flame in your heart
13705,Just for a day
13706,Congratulations!!
13707,"Somehow, a hash text file using ancient crypto can be exchanged for real goods &amp; services!? Amazing."
13708,"To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I dont even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldnt look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is almost."
13709,"Teslas action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&amp500 company."
13710,SpaceX in south Texas &amp; Tesla in central have been providing direct assistance where feasible (eg save cold turtles &amp; help power the water treatment plant). Please let us know if we may be helpful in other ways.
13711,Yes
13712,. is not earning that R
13713,Youre right
13714,"Covered in snow &amp; ice, roads mostly closed &amp; no power in Austin"
13715,There will definitely be a MarsCoin!
13716,Sounds like it is
13717,Yeah. Active fairing half recovered though.
13718,SpaceX Boca team is helping save the turtles
13719,Disturbing concentration
13720,Only if necessary
13721,Absolutely
13722,I will literally pay actual $ if they just void their accounts
13723,Yup
13724,"Temporarily lower, long-term raise"
13725,An acceptable percentage. Doge is much more concentrated.
13726,"If major Dogecoin holders sell most of their coins, it will get my full support. Too much concentration is the only real issue imo."
13727,Success on landing probability is ~60% this time
13728,. would you like join me for a conversation on Clubhouse?
13729,Lil meme juice for the weekend
13730,"Good analysis. Were working on lowering min throttle of Raptor, so that there is engine redundancy throughout the landing burn."
13731,"Yup. Banks are basically balkanized, heterogeneous databases with high latency &amp; weak security, especially ACH transfers &amp; credit cards."
13732,A know a thing or two about payments
13733,Im an alien
13734,Ray tracing on Cyberpunk with HDR is next-level. Have you tried it?
13735,Great interview!
13736,Doge is underestimated
13737,Congratulations Tesla China for amazing execution last year. Now on to the next for even more!!
13738,Happy New Year of the Ox!
13739,"Frodo was the underdoge, All thought he would fail, Himself most of all."
13740,Haha thanks
13741,Indeed! Tweets definitely do not represent real-world time allocation.
13742,The most entertaining outcome is the most likely
13743,Just sent some
13744,Just agree to do Clubhouse with
13745,Its getting real
13746,"Bought some Dogecoin for lil X, so he can be a toddler hodler"
13747,"He definitely has issues, but the sentencing seems a bit high"
13748,Thanks for fixing
13749,Please unlock my account
13750,This is true power haha
13751,Any crypto wallet that wont give you your private keys should be avoided at all costs
13752,Your app sucks
13753,Yes
13754,"Once we can predict cash flow reasonably well, Starlink will IPO"
13755,"Starlink is a staggeringly difficult technical &amp; economic endeavor. However, if we dont fail, the cost to end users will improve every year."
13756,SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.
13757,"Lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered, net of value of any product made. Must be scalable to gigaton level. Aiming for maximum usefulness."
13758,Its meant to be the same price in all countries. Only difference should be taxes &amp; shipping.
13759,"This is intended for Earth, but there may be some ideas that apply to Mars too"
13760,XPrize team will manage the $100M carbon capture prize
13761,"Everyone at Tesla receives stock. My comp is all stock/options, which I do not take off the table. Thats what youre missing."
13762,Back to work I go
13763,Does seem a bit high
13764,"Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault. Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster."
13765,Wow
13766,. Orbital launch tower that can stack . Enough Raptors for orbit booster . Improve ship &amp; booster mass
13767,Back to work tonight!
13768,is for ogecoin! Instructional video.
13769,The people have spoken
13770,So cute
13771,"Extremely misleading image, as doesnt reflect true time cost to people or rain &amp; pain"
13772,Who let the Doge out
13773,Hodl the rainforests!!
13774,So its finally come to this
13775,Its the most fun crypto!
13776,Its simplicity is its genius
13777,Yup
13778,True
13779,"Not that easy. This is two decades of intense work. Have to look at old notes, emails, texts."
13780,Yes
13781,Lessons learned
13782,Of Earth and Mars
13783,Time to tell the story of Tesla &amp; SpaceX
13784,Have you read ? Its great!!
13785,The Second Last Kingdom
13786,Havent heard that name in years
13787,Dogecake
13788,YOLT
13789,Thats Damian
13790,Yeah
13791,Sure
13792,The great thing about restaurants is that you get to hang out with strangers! - SJM
13793,The future currency of Earth
13794,Just a scratch
13795,Much wow!
13796,Destiny
13797,Franz was essential
13798,"That said, the ship landing burn has a clear solution. My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid &amp; full reusability, without which we shall forever be confined to Earth."
13799,"Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs sec Isp)"
13800,Higher Isp too
13801,"Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; theyre already there"
13802,Yes
13803,Its true!
13804,"Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all are good."
13805,"Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky"
13806,Yes
13807,"It was foolish of us not to start engines &amp; immediately shut down , as are needed to land"
13808,"I am become meme, Destroyer of shorts"
13809,Might actually happen
13810,Sandstorm is a masterpiece
13811,We were too dumb
13812,"Next time, we try pull *up* method"
13813,Low-key Loki
13814,"No highs, no lows, only Doge"
13815,No need to be a gigachad to own

13820,High seas &amp; wind
13821,This was a tough one
13822,Off Twitter for a while
13823,It will be filled with graffiti art
13824,Giga Berlin progress
13825,"Neuralink is working super hard to ensure implant safety &amp; is in close communication with the FDA. If things go well, we might be able to do initial human trials later this year."
13826,"If youve worked on advanced wearables, phones or robots, those skills are needed"
13827,Feels weird helping make (hopefully good version of) Cyberpunk come true
13828,Please consider working at Neuralink! Short-term: solve brain/spine injuries Long-term: human/AI symbiosis Latter will be species-level important Work at either at our Bay Area or Austin locations
13829,On Clubhouse tonight at pm LA time
13830,Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
13831,"He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage."
13832,That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
13833,"Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor"
13834,"T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W."
13835,No escaping that for me
13836,Read the whole article
13837,"Warm, sunny day &amp; snowy mountains"
13838,What a beautiful day in LA
13839,"Yeah, Dr Frankensteen"
13840,I never used this guy. He gave a talk at SpaceX once.
13841,Only Halo
13842,I sure hope thats not true at Tesla or SpaceX!
13843,"Cryoproof, then install engines"
13844,Starship SN9 &amp; SN10
13845,"In retrospect, it was inevitable"
13846,Great shot
13847,"Live by the sword, die by the sword"
13848,Entropy
13849,Buy &amp; hold companies that make goods &amp; produce services you love
13850,Earth is small &amp; we are smaller still
13851,"With Cyberpunk, even the hotfixes literally have hotfixes, but great game"
13852,The dollar is shorting itself
13853,Indeed
13854,Shopify is great too. SpaceX used them.
13855,Indeed. The economy making useful products &amp; providing great services is what actually matters.
13856,"TANSTAAFL. Would be better to have small fees than no fees, as latter makes Robinhood beholden to big trading houses. Got to pay the bills somehow. Even Etsy has fees."
13857,Here come the shorty apologists Give them no respect Get Shorty
13858,u cant sell houses u dont own u cant sell cars u dont own but u *can* sell stock u dont own!? this is bs shorting is a scam legal only for vestigial reasons
13859,Yes
13860,"Finishing engineering this year, production starts next year. Aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer. Tri-motor drive system &amp; advanced battery work were important precursors."
13861,I made that video!
13862,Absolutely
13863,"Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure. Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars."
13864,Nomad
13865,The esthetics of Cyberpunk are incredible btw. The interior design is.
13866,Major esthetics improvements coming
13867,A little
13868,New Roadster is part rocket
13869,Theres more storage now &amp; easily upgradable
13870,Yes
13871,"Yeah, probably in a few months"
13872,"After you drive without using a PRND stalk/stick for a few days, it gets very annoying to go back &amp; use a shifter!"
13873,"No more stalks. Car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees, context &amp; nav map. You can override on touchscreen."
13874,A hedge fund that shorts is a shrubbery
13875,"Yeah, also a rear screen"
13876,to mph trap speed in a /4 mile. mph top speed (with right tires).
13877,First production car ever to achieve to mph in less than seconds
13878,It can play Cyberpunk
13879,Plaid Model S ships next month
13880,Even Discord has gone corpo
13881,Yup. Wild times on Discord haha.
13882,Waiting for FAA review
13883,Gamestonk!!
13884,Passed initial pressure test
13885,Yes
13886,Bought a hand knit wool Marvin the Martian helm for my dog
13887,I kinda love Etsy
13888,It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation
13889,Were hoping for FAA approval of a test flight tomorrow afternoon
13890,"The entire stack from data collection through labeling &amp; inference has to be in surround video. This is a hard problem. Critically, however, this does not require a hardware change to cars in field."
13891,"Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn on FSD"
13892,Tesla is steadily moving all NNs to camera surround video. This will enable superhuman self-driving.
13893,"[Some tyranny]. Also, the road to hell is mostly paved with bad intentions."
13894,Catchy!
13895,All sats launched next year will have laser links. Only our polar sats have lasers this year &amp; are v0.9.
13896,Yup
13897,I hope so
13898,"These also have laser links between the satellites, so no ground stations are needed over the poles"
13899,Sorry for the version confusion. V8.1 is what it should say for FSD. Separate version number for rest of car.
13900,"To my surprise, Tesla has better AI hardware &amp; software than Waymo (money)"
13901,It floats
13902,Fallout-themed opening party for Vegas Loop happening as soon as allowed!
13903,Under Vegas in tunnel yesterday with my boys
13904,Lasers
13905,Were switching to a more sensible FSD version numbering to distinguish between major &amp; minor updates. Current build is FSD . It drove me to an unfamiliar location in LA &amp; back last night with no interventions!
13906,"Hopefully, early next week"
13907,"Given so many other companies are depending on this mission, it is getting even more scrutiny than a Starlink flight"
13908,Launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow. Excited about offering low-cost access to orbit for small companies!
13909,"They are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water &amp; land. We may need something thats ultra-large- scale industrial in to years. For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy."
13910,SN9
13911,"Its a good path for fully renewable rocket energy, so solves part of problem, but longer chain hydrocarbons than CH4 are needed to be solid at room temp"
13912,Details next week
13913,Am donating $100M towards a prize for best carbon capture technology
13914,Pretty much
13915,"That would probably mean civilization is doing great, although depends on assumptions for inflation haha"
13916,Hes everywhere
13917,Absolutely! They rock.
13918,The rate-limiting part or process in cell production is constantly changing
13919,"Cars &amp; trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases &amp; particulate, but road tunnels under Miami would solve traffic &amp; be an example to the world. Spoke with about tunnels last week. If Governor &amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it."
13920,"With our giant casting machines, we are literally trying to make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made"
13921,Tegmark is an exceptionally smart &amp; good human
13922,"The best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries, like food &amp; beverage, some medical (eg syringes) &amp; toys"
13923,Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem.
13924,Looking into this. No question that FSD should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a trade-in.
13925,For sure
13926,Glad youre ok
13927,Congratulations!
13928,This is a good one
13929,I whistle
13930,Cybertruck doesnt need a garage
13931,It will be awesome
13932,Good point
13933,Your server-side code is doing too much
13934,Happy birthday Wikipedia! So glad you exist.
13935,Guess you been watching Cobra Kai
13936,Fallout New Texas
13937,Only Chuck Norris can divide by zero
13938,Good point
13939,The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. What actually matters is making goods &amp; providing services. We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. Whichever has least error &amp; latency will win.
13940,Monty Python is amazing
13941,They sure can twist the knife in that show!
13942,Probably wise
13943,Were making major improvements to ease of engine swap. Needs to be a few hours at most.
13944,"Two of the engines need slight repairs, so will be switched out"
13945,Nice shot
13946,"We dont have high school internships, but please apply when youre in college!"
13947,"Prototypes are easy, volume production is hard, positive cash flow is excruciating"

13949,Detanking &amp; inspections now. Good progress towards our Hop in &amp; go to Mars! goal.
13950,All three static fires completed &amp; no RUDs!
13951,"Wow, a lot has happened in years!"
13952,Fair enough haha
13953,Sea shanty tiktok takes it to a new level with actual pirate ships
13954,Sure
13955,"Today at SpaceX is about practicing Starship engine starts. Ship is held down by massive pins while engines are fired. Two starts completed, about to try a third."
13956,As promised
13957,Legalize comedy
13958,You can steal our name/logos &amp; we probably wont sue you
13959,Were just trying to get people to Mars. Help would be appreciated.
13960,"One day, we will get a camera up there that also shows the star field in the background"
13961,Suicide is more than double homicide
13962,Absolutely

13970,It is
13971,"Once in a while, something happens that is even better than we imagined"
13972,The factory is the product
13973,Probably commenting on will do more
13974,I bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for $20. Theyre great places to get spare parts.
13975,A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech
13976,Already donated to Signal a year ago. Will donate more.
13977,"I am primarily trying to advance two causes: sustainable energy &amp; extending life/consciousness beyond Earth. There is also the existential threat of AI, which we should aspire to mitigate. This doesnt leave time to write books."
13978,Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year
13979,The Prancing Pony?
13980,Its true
13981,"Yes, but not for long"
13982,"Yeah, they seemed optimistic too"
13983,"My -year-old son, Saxon, said he feels like will be a good year. I agree. Let us all make it so."
13984,Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time
13985,"I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar."
13986,That too
13987,Catapult high into the air &amp; land on the roof with a base jumping parachute (the only way to travel)
13988,"Thats actually our restaurant, but SpaceX is building a futuristic bar at the top of the high bay with degree windows &amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory"
13989,And increase fun! Hopefully.
13990,Me neither
13991,One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations
13992,"No, but maybe one day"
13993,"Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits."
13994,His sick beats
13995,"Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three."
13996,"Or at least the option for verification, so that the public can ascribe more credibility to verified vs unverified accounts"
13997,Launch underway
13998,"Btw, critical feedback is always super appreciated, as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems)"
13999,Yup
14000,"Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O &gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time."
14001,"Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but thats more of a long-term solution."
14002,"This will be hard to make, as it isnt like any other vehicle"
14003,Playing the long game
14004,True
14005,"I hope so. Wings dont work on the moon at all and def not well on Mars. Also, no runways."
14006,Hamiltonians have +2V the potential of Langrangians and a play!
14007,"Well, back to work"
14008,How strange
14009,Use Signal
14010,Ya dont say. Reminds me of this timeless classic
14011,Fast water with tiny rocks
14012,"Yes, and then Occams razor is actually third most likely"
14013,"As seen from an external observer, not the participants"
14014,The most entertaining outcome is the most likely
14015,Dumb and Dumber is a great movie tho
14016,This is called the domino effect
14017,Doesnt quite illustrate true size difference. Starship payload volume &amp; mass are &gt;1000% that of Shuttle.
14018,"Because of the large footprint, it may seem flat, but actually ranges up to stories tall"
14019,Snow falling on Giga Berlin
14020,Yes
14021,Tesla is responsible for /3 of all the personal &amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.
14022,"So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a % chance of surviving at all."
14023,"Um, we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance"
14024,"Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Cant speak for regulators though."
14025,"Dojo isnt needed, but will make self-driving better. It isnt enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than times safer than human drivers."
14026,"In a way, this is free QA haha"
14027,A beautiful home for life
14028,Some Starlink terminals near conflict areas were being jammed for several hours at a time. Our latest software update bypasses the jamming. Am curious to see whats next!
14029,Exactly
14030,"All news sources are partially propaganda, some more than others"
14031,Starlink has been told by some governments (not Ukraine) to block Russian news sources. We will not do so unless at gunpoint. Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.
14032,SpaceX reprioritized to cyber defense &amp; overcoming signal jamming. Will cause slight delays in Starship &amp; Starlink V2.
14033,"Who, me?"
14034,Exactly
14035,"And also my sympathies to the great people of Russia, who do not want this"
14036,Hold Strong Ukraine
14037,"Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil &amp; gas exports."
14038,"Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil &amp; gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures."
14039,Haha sure
14040,Ich mchte mich recht herzlich bedanken. Die Zukunft ist sehr spannend!
14041,You will be in the future
14042,Game on
14043,"Almost all Viasat Ukraine user terminals were rendered permanently unusable by a Russian cyberattack on day of invasion, so yes"
14044,"Yes, provided no metal particles in paint"
14045,Place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection
14046,Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible
14047,"Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high. Please use with caution."
14048,"In class action lawsuits, the actual plaintiff is always the class action law firm. They just find someone willing to serve as a puppet to represent the class."
14049,"Updating software to reduce peak power consumption, so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter. Mobile roaming enabled, so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle."
14050,American Broomstick
14051,"Yeah, maybe"
14052,This old YouTube clip helps explain why former UAW members who work at Tesla are not huge fans of UAW
14053,Yes
14054,"By the way, Tesla factory worker compensation is the highest in the auto industry"
14055,"Our real challenge is Bay Area has negative unemployment, so if we dont treat and compensate our (awesome) people well, they have many other offers and will just leave! Id like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them."
14056,"Actually, we still operate our California factory, which is the largest auto plant in North America, at full capacity and are considering expanding it significantly. It has built /3 of all electric vehicles in North America, twice as much as all other carmakers combined."
14057,Ukraine civilian Internet was experiencing strange outages bad weather perhaps? so SpaceX is helping fix it
14058,"Solar area will need to be higher with obscuration, but works better than one might think"
14059,"Solar panels + battery pack better than generator, as no heat signature or smoke &amp; doesnt run out of fuel"
14060,"We couldve made a mile Model S months ago, but that wouldve made the product worse imo, as % of time youd be carrying unneeded battery mass, which makes acceleration, handling &amp; efficiency worse. Even our + mile range car is more than almost anyone will use."
14061,"That was me tweeting from when someone else had snatched my name. I was actually one of the earliest Twitter users, but dropped my account because people were tweeting such trivialities at first. convinced me to get back in."
14062,The probability of Tesla dying in /2009 was very high. We closed our financing round at pm on Dec th the last working hour of the last day before Tesla would otherwise bounce payroll.
14063,"Self-driving cars &amp; useful humanoid robots require a sophisticated understanding of reality. I am increasingly convinced that they are on the path to solving AGI. Should AGI be solved? I dont know, but humanity is moving rapidly in this direction whether I like it or not."
14064,"Pretty good summary, although national pride is underweighted relative to economics. Latter serves former, not other way around. The foundational issue imo, which this video doesnt ignore, is low birth rate. After all, what good is land with no people?"
14065,Saints Row IV was sickkk
14066,Saints Row
14067,"Well, I do have multiple personality disorder, but theyre all technically in the same head"
14068,Investigating
14069,Tesla has created over US jobs building electric vehicles &amp; is investing more than double GM + Ford combined [fyi to person controlling this twitter]
14070,"Our primary challenge is affordability. Creating an expensive truck is relatively easy. If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla, despite our much greater economies of scale &amp; better technology, then it is damn near impossible for others."
14071,He plays golf a lot
14072,"Saudi Arabia owns /3 of Lucid, so inevitable"
14073,Their negative gross margin will be staggering
14074,"Coming soon, if you want your car to make a loud farting sound from the external speaker, just say Fart in their general direction!"
14075,"All cars made since November also have push center for horn just waiting on firmware update. If you mash right side of yoke with your palm, horn will trigger."
14076,"If your war technology level is far higher than your opponent, tactics dont matter: source_not_found"
14077,Swipe down on navigate button to navigate home or to work if at home
14078,"Depends on what issues we see that are unique to Canada. If things are looking good, then we can lower the safety score threshold."
14079,You are most welcome
14080,Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.
14081,Good thread
14082,Yes
14083,Would be a good move. Needs to include put options &amp; synthetic shorts.
14084,Successful Starlink deploy
14085,Weve had about or so cars testing internally in Canada. Hoping to go wider this weekend.
14086,"Starlink is a little patchy to Tonga right now, but will improve dramatically as laser inter-satellite links activate"
14087,Yes
14088,"LIDAR is a seductive local maximum. SpaceX designed &amp; built them to dock with ISS. However, the road system was designed to work with biological neural nets &amp; eyes, so a general solution to self-driving necessarily will require silicon neural nets &amp; cameras. Real-world AI."
14089,Protagonists created over half a century ago dont count
14090,Signal is the least insecure messaging service
14091,Hollywood refuses to write even one story about an actual company startup where the CEO isnt a dweeb and/or evil
14092,Just iMessage &amp; Signal
14093,Me too
14094,"Actual question, not rhetorical"
14095,Are you sure Signal is secure?
14096,"I didnt start the fight, but I will finish it."
14097,Building a case is exactly what Ive been doing
14098,Exactly
14099,Would be cool if we are backed up somehow
14100,Yeah
14101,"Yeah, definitely dont use C unless optimizing for hardware performance!"
14102,"Im a fan of Rust. Clearly scales well, given that Discord uses it. For max performance, however, nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer. Otherwise, we mostly use C++ &amp; Python."
14103,"While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the hard one, in fact they are all difficult &amp; important. Tight C &amp; custom compiler too. An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability &amp; long life is also critical. Cant just jam GPUs in the trunk."
14104,Definitely
14105,"A general solution to self-driving (essentially, real-world AI) requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training, inference, control, analytical tools, data management, hardware optimization &amp; simulation. One of the hardest technology problems that exists."
14106,Compilers can be way better too. Not enough effort spent there.
14107,Sorry!
14108,Were working through the general case of making Steam games work on a Tesla vs specific titles. Former is obviously where we should be long-term.
14109,Yes. This is an advantage of iron cathode lithium batteries.
14110,Night City has beautiful art
14111,Great game
14112,But % of statistics are false
14113,Norway is awesome!
14114,"Small changes usually affect production for less than an hour, as theyre applied to a few stations during breaks. Big changes may impact output for a day or two. Reversing out big changes or unexpected parts shortages are what impact several days."
14115,Sometimes small changes in a single week
14116,"Switching to renewables with batteries would avoid blackouts. Batteries are essential, due to the intermittent nature of renewables."
14117,We must fight for it to be better
14118,This is just peeling back the first layer of the corruption onion. Stay tuned

14139,Single biggest threat to future of civilization imo
14140,Ok
14141,They will be fine
14142,"The only reason I didnt pay federal tax in is because I *overpaid* in ! Since they stole my tax records, they actually know that."
14143,Hypocritical megadouche!
14144,"Will visit IRS next time Im in DC just to say hi, since I paid the most taxes ever in history for an individual last year. Maybe I can have a cookie or something"
14145,True
14146,Seriously. How long must this go on?
14147,"Depends mostly on FAA certification, but hopefully within months. Were testing on Gulfstreams to debug issues, but deployment priority is commercial airliners."
14148,Cybertruck
14149,"Yes, in the air"

14176,"I was at a lunch with Munger in where he told the whole table all the ways Tesla would fail. Made me quite sad, but I told him I agreed with all those reasons &amp; that we would probably die, but it was worth trying anyway."
14177,Some carmakers are trying hard
14178,[ahem]
14179,Ok
14180,No way

14213,Tower arms are lifting Starship onto Super Heavy Booster
14214,This would generate a lot of goodwill
14215,Much appreciated!
14216,Model X is an extremely difficult car to build. Most complex passenger car ever. Limiting factor is interior trim.
14217,We dropped the ball badly regarding new Model X production ramp &amp; still havent fully recovered. Was idiotic to stop production of old X in Dec when there was still plenty of demand!
14218,Pretty much

14220,Tesla
14221,Yup!
14222,"Most news outlets attempt to answer the question: What are the worst things happening on Earth today? Its a big planet! Obviously, some bad things are happening somewhere at any given time, but focusing relentlessly on those does not give an accurate picture of reality."
14223,So hard to find out whats going on in the world without being bombarded with news that makes one sad &amp; angry!
14224,"True, careless negativity (destruction) is much harder than thoughtful positivity (creation)"
14225,Sadly true
14226,"Thats true to some degree, but citizen podcasts that arent negative like Rogan, Fridman, Dodd, TED interviews, etc are very popular. Maybe part of why traditional media outlets are so negative is because old habits die hard? They so rarely even try to be positive."
14227,Not needed
14228,Why is the traditional media such a relentless hatestream? Real question.
14229,Fate Irony

14254,"Starship aspires to be the first fully reusable orbital launch vehicle, the holy grail of rocketry. This is the critical breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary."
14255,And all the forms of life on Earth
14256,Becoming multiplanetary is essential to extending dramatically the probable lifespan of civilization
14257,Starship is in a different league. Orders of magnitude more mass to orbit than Falcon. Necessary for creating a self-sustaining city on Mars.
14258,"If things go well, Falcon will launch about once a week on average in , delivering ~2/3 of all Earth payload to orbit"
14259,Tesla is working hard to provide more Megapacks for grid stabilization
14260,Congrats SpaceX Falcon team!
14261,Exactly. The terminology is anachronistic.

14297,"If Canadian government is suppressing peaceful protests, thats where fascism lies &amp; cartoonist is just a shill"
14298,Yup
14299,"Now that the big automotive advertisers are making EVs, you will see far fewer articles about EVs catching on fire. It is not surprising that internal combustion engine cars have a tendency to combust externally too."
14300,Just rewatched True Romance
14301,The ratio of machine to human compute skyrockets
14302,True
14303,Voters should call their elected politicians now to make it clear how they feel

14305,We need serious tonnage to Mars
14306,The Universe is a Hydrogen Sonata
14307,There are many faux
14308,It has been a very long road
14309,Interesting ideas
14310,There will only be EVs in the future
14311,Excited for future of solar at Tesla!
14312,Tesla will support FSD licensing by other manufacturers
14313,"Disney in the streets, Euphoria in the sheets"
14314,I have one
14315,"Given how hard insanely FSD is, I think it may take years or more before any company besides Tesla solves it"
14316,I have a feeling that the gerrymandering will not work as well as they think
14317,And in the darkness bind them
14318,"Honestly, I would let the border regions vote. Let the people there actually decide."
14319,Vote them out
14320,"If you scare people enough, they will demand removal of freedom. This is the path to tyranny."
14321,Seems odd that the UN still hasnt released world death rates
14322,Freedom is being stripped away one piece at a time until it is gone
14323,"Manganese also requires less lithium, as it operates at higher voltage"
14324,Just that manganese is an alternative to iron &amp; phosphorus for scaling cathode production to several TWh/year
14325,Exactly
14326,Your policies are directly responsible for the outrageously high insurance premiums paid by Californians
14327,You should be voted out of office

14329,Exactly
14330,I am in awe of Sweden
14331,Canadian truckers rule
14332,Biden is treating the American public like fools

14336,Je maple syrup
14337,"Theyre being driven around in limousines, so they cant grok it"
14338,"Sounds about right for autonomous cars. Optimus will greatly exceed this. The economy will be as big as people want it to be. There will be no scarcity, except that which is artificially created."
14339,They appear to have some room for improvement
14340,Been driving latest Cybertruck prototype around Giga Texas. Its awesome!
14341,I have trouble understanding any other motivations tbh
14342,Nice
14343,Its like he could see the future!
14344,I will eat a happy meal on tv if accepts Dogecoin
14345,This is a matter of much internal debate
14346,Our biggest limitation with Fremont is convincing enough associates to build cars when they have so many other job opportunities in the Bay Area! Thanks again Tesla team for doing the hard work of building real products that people love
14347,I sense a trend
14348,Great wisdom
14349,Twitter is spending engineering resources on this bs while crypto scammers are throwing a spambot block party in every thread!?
14350,This is annoying
14351,"This is a hard thing for us to do right now, as we dont have enough satellites with laser links and there are already geo sats that serve the Tonga region. That is why Im asking for clear confirmation."
14352,"Yeah, this saves a whole tap. Just swipe down for auto navigate."
14353,Could people from Tonga let us know if it is important for SpaceX to send over Starlink terminals?
14354,wtf
14355,An SUV that is faster than a Formula race car
14356,Baby X is just like this haha
14357,Most people have no idea
14358,Yeah
14359,Maybe something like this
14360,Frank &amp; Beans
14361,Its true I do think a lot about rocket engine chamber pressure ahaha
14362,Same
14363,Ok
14364,But is he playing it on Legendary difficulty?
14365,Will do our best. Decentralized control of the robots will be critical.
14366,Sheer luck
14367,I hear versions of this often irl
14368,"Tesla AI might play a role in AGI, given that it trains against the outside world, especially with the advent of Optimus"
14369,Believe in the future!
14370,Back to the moon soon
14371,Another Starlinks reach orbit
14372,I was just there. Good progress!
14373,People do not yet understand how valuable an autonomous vehicle will be
14374,"Last year, Japan had ~800k births &amp; life expectancy is years (impressively high!), implying future population of only M, dropping almost half from current population of M. Thats a lot of ghost towns &amp; cities."
14375,Tragic case of ego/ability&gt;&gt;1
14376,"If there arent enough people for Earth, then there definitely wont be enough for Mars"
14377,Trying to set a good example
14378,Exactly
14379,"UN projections are utter nonsense. Just multiply last years births by life expectancy. Given downward trend in birth rate, that is best case unless reversed."
14380,We should be much more worried about population collapse
14381,I see where Frank Herbert got some of his ideas
14382,Yup
14383,Honestly I woulda clicked it
14384,"Spatial &amp; temporal memory are improving, so there will be less flicker"
14385,"Yeah, unfortunately this is becoming a security issue"
14386,"Cool, were both born days after /20 haha"
14387,"I obv cant comment on every rumor, but this isnt true. Am headed to Berlin mid Feb, not this week."
14388,Pretty wild
14389,The most entertaining outcome is the most likely
14390,Accurate video
14391,going out later this week
14392,Indeed
14393,Yeah
14394,We will start rolling out FSD beta in Canada cautiously in next to weeks
14395,Good thing I never tweet anything controversial
14396,Green Hills software is a pile of trash. Linux ftw.
14397,It is heartening to see the rise of individualist vs corporate media
14398,"In theory, it saves landing leg mass &amp; enables immediate reflight of an otherwise unwieldy, giant rocket"
14399,Correct
14400,Good campaign
14401,There sure are a lot of interesting ways to arrange pixels
14402,AI in a box that is a hall of mirrors from the inside
14403,Civilization is only ~5000 years old
14404,So informative
14405,"There is a chance of *all* species extinction due to expansion of the sun, unless humanity makes life multiplanetary"
14406,Firmware fix to recalibrate heat pump expansion valve is rolling out now
14407,Fixing this is a high priority
14408,Starlink satellites active moving to operational orbits Laser links activate soon
14409,Big difference
14410,Birds are a myth
14411,Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin
14412,"Yeah, doesnt make sense"
14413,Almost all input is error. Car should do the right thing automatically.
14414,Dojo
14415,Yup
14416,Turns out yes
14417,Still working through a lot of challenges with the government
14418,Great explanation!
14419,He was truly exceptional
14420,Bizarre anti-environment move by govt of California
14421,"Tesla is working as fast as possible to support Tesla owners worldwide. Sustainable energy affects everyone on Earth, as we all share one atmosphere."
14422,Accurate
14423,Most people have no idea how fast sustainable energy is growing!
14424,"If the alarming collapse in birth rate continues, civilization will indeed die with a whimper in adult diapers"
14425,Mind-blowing that over % of humans have a smart phone
14426,Starship launch &amp; catch tower
14427,"Its our best car ever, along with the Plaid X"
14428,"It was a mistake to try to use the Elise. In the end, only ~5% of the Elise parts ended up being used. Tesla Roadster is a totally different car."
14429,Monthly subscription price will rise when FSD goes to wide release
14430,FSD price will rise as we get closer to FSD production code release
14431,Just in the US
14432,Tesla FSD price rising to $12k on Jan
14433,Beta should be ready in about a week. Beta with single city/highway software stack &amp; many other architectural upgrades probably next month.
14434,Starlinks with lasers deployed to orbit
14435,Masters of Doom is a great book
14436,nice
14437,Room to improve
14438,Earth should be called Water
14439,Tonnage to orbit is the more fundamental metric
14440,Absolutely. This is just bad math.
14441,Yes
14442,Raptor now operates routinely at bar main chamber pressure
14443,Reminds me of when I hex edited Ultima V to get out of the final maze
14444,Yay Switzerland!!
14445,There is no way to be in touch with voters when youre three generations away from voting age
14446,Lets make the roaring s happen!
14447,Great work by Tesla team worldwide!
14448,"In a way, this is free QA haha"
14449,A beautiful home for life
14450,Some Starlink terminals near conflict areas were being jammed for several hours at a time. Our latest software update bypasses the jamming. Am curious to see whats next!
14451,Exactly
14452,"All news sources are partially propaganda, some more than others"
14453,Starlink has been told by some governments (not Ukraine) to block Russian news sources. We will not do so unless at gunpoint. Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.
14454,SpaceX reprioritized to cyber defense &amp; overcoming signal jamming. Will cause slight delays in Starship &amp; Starlink V2.
14455,"Who, me?"
14456,Exactly
14457,"And also my sympathies to the great people of Russia, who do not want this"
14458,Hold Strong Ukraine
14459,"Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil &amp; gas exports."
14460,"Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil &amp; gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures."
14461,Haha sure
14462,Ich mchte mich recht herzlich bedanken. Die Zukunft ist sehr spannend!
14463,You will be in the future
14464,Game on
14465,"Almost all Viasat Ukraine user terminals were rendered permanently unusable by a Russian cyberattack on day of invasion, so yes"
14466,"Yes, provided no metal particles in paint"
14467,Place light camouflage over antenna to avoid visual detection
14468,Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible
14469,"Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high. Please use with caution."
14470,"In class action lawsuits, the actual plaintiff is always the class action law firm. They just find someone willing to serve as a puppet to represent the class."
14471,"Updating software to reduce peak power consumption, so Starlink can be powered from car cigarette lighter. Mobile roaming enabled, so phased array antenna can maintain signal while on moving vehicle."
14472,American Broomstick
14473,"Yeah, maybe"
14474,This old YouTube clip helps explain why former UAW members who work at Tesla are not huge fans of UAW
14475,Yes
14476,"By the way, Tesla factory worker compensation is the highest in the auto industry"
14477,"Our real challenge is Bay Area has negative unemployment, so if we dont treat and compensate our (awesome) people well, they have many other offers and will just leave! Id like hereby to invite UAW to hold a union vote at their convenience. Tesla will do nothing to stop them."
14478,"Actually, we still operate our California factory, which is the largest auto plant in North America, at full capacity and are considering expanding it significantly. It has built /3 of all electric vehicles in North America, twice as much as all other carmakers combined."
14479,Ukraine civilian Internet was experiencing strange outages bad weather perhaps? so SpaceX is helping fix it
14480,"Solar area will need to be higher with obscuration, but works better than one might think"
14481,"Solar panels + battery pack better than generator, as no heat signature or smoke &amp; doesnt run out of fuel"
14482,"We couldve made a mile Model S months ago, but that wouldve made the product worse imo, as % of time youd be carrying unneeded battery mass, which makes acceleration, handling &amp; efficiency worse. Even our + mile range car is more than almost anyone will use."
14483,"That was me tweeting from when someone else had snatched my name. I was actually one of the earliest Twitter users, but dropped my account because people were tweeting such trivialities at first. convinced me to get back in."
14484,The probability of Tesla dying in /2009 was very high. We closed our financing round at pm on Dec th the last working hour of the last day before Tesla would otherwise bounce payroll.
14485,"Self-driving cars &amp; useful humanoid robots require a sophisticated understanding of reality. I am increasingly convinced that they are on the path to solving AGI. Should AGI be solved? I dont know, but humanity is moving rapidly in this direction whether I like it or not."
14486,"Pretty good summary, although national pride is underweighted relative to economics. Latter serves former, not other way around. The foundational issue imo, which this video doesnt ignore, is low birth rate. After all, what good is land with no people?"
14487,Saints Row IV was sickkk
14488,Saints Row
14489,"Well, I do have multiple personality disorder, but theyre all technically in the same head"
14490,Investigating
14491,Tesla has created over US jobs building electric vehicles &amp; is investing more than double GM + Ford combined [fyi to person controlling this twitter]
14492,"Our primary challenge is affordability. Creating an expensive truck is relatively easy. If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla, despite our much greater economies of scale &amp; better technology, then it is damn near impossible for others."
14493,He plays golf a lot
14494,"Saudi Arabia owns /3 of Lucid, so inevitable"
14495,Their negative gross margin will be staggering
14496,"Coming soon, if you want your car to make a loud farting sound from the external speaker, just say Fart in their general direction!"
14497,"All cars made since November also have push center for horn just waiting on firmware update. If you mash right side of yoke with your palm, horn will trigger."
14498,"If your war technology level is far higher than your opponent, tactics dont matter: source_not_found"
14499,Swipe down on navigate button to navigate home or to work if at home
14500,"Depends on what issues we see that are unique to Canada. If things are looking good, then we can lower the safety score threshold."
14501,You are most welcome
14502,Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.
14503,Good thread
14504,Yes
14505,Would be a good move. Needs to include put options &amp; synthetic shorts.
14506,Successful Starlink deploy
14507,Weve had about or so cars testing internally in Canada. Hoping to go wider this weekend.
14508,"Starlink is a little patchy to Tonga right now, but will improve dramatically as laser inter-satellite links activate"
14509,Yes
14510,"LIDAR is a seductive local maximum. SpaceX designed &amp; built them to dock with ISS. However, the road system was designed to work with biological neural nets &amp; eyes, so a general solution to self-driving necessarily will require silicon neural nets &amp; cameras. Real-world AI."
14511,Protagonists created over half a century ago dont count
14512,Signal is the least insecure messaging service
14513,Hollywood refuses to write even one story about an actual company startup where the CEO isnt a dweeb and/or evil
14514,Just iMessage &amp; Signal
14515,Me too
14516,"Actual question, not rhetorical"
14517,Are you sure Signal is secure?
14518,"I didnt start the fight, but I will finish it."
14519,Building a case is exactly what Ive been doing
14520,Exactly
14521,Would be cool if we are backed up somehow
14522,Yeah
14523,"Yeah, definitely dont use C unless optimizing for hardware performance!"
14524,"Im a fan of Rust. Clearly scales well, given that Discord uses it. For max performance, however, nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer. Otherwise, we mostly use C++ &amp; Python."
14525,"While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the hard one, in fact they are all difficult &amp; important. Tight C &amp; custom compiler too. An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability &amp; long life is also critical. Cant just jam GPUs in the trunk."
14526,Definitely
14527,"A general solution to self-driving (essentially, real-world AI) requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training, inference, control, analytical tools, data management, hardware optimization &amp; simulation. One of the hardest technology problems that exists."
14528,Compilers can be way better too. Not enough effort spent there.
14529,Sorry!
14530,Were working through the general case of making Steam games work on a Tesla vs specific titles. Former is obviously where we should be long-term.
14531,Yes. This is an advantage of iron cathode lithium batteries.
14532,Night City has beautiful art
14533,Great game
14534,But % of statistics are false
14535,Norway is awesome!
14536,"Small changes usually affect production for less than an hour, as theyre applied to a few stations during breaks. Big changes may impact output for a day or two. Reversing out big changes or unexpected parts shortages are what impact several days."
14537,Sometimes small changes in a single week
14538,"Switching to renewables with batteries would avoid blackouts. Batteries are essential, due to the intermittent nature of renewables."
14539,We must fight for it to be better
14540,This is just peeling back the first layer of the corruption onion. Stay tuned

14555,That would be great
14556,"Maybe near BRO airport, since that serves both communities?"
14557,"If South Padre and/or Brownsville would like a Starship prototype, we can send one over"
14558,"Im pretty sure Ive paid the most taxes of any individual ever to California, but it isnt obvious what is done with the money"
14559,"Rather than correcting itself, the lower birth rate trend appears to be accelerating"
14560,"Tesla owners in the greater Giga Texas area will get priority, so yes"
14561,Single biggest threat to future of civilization imo
14562,Ok
14563,They will be fine
14564,"The only reason I didnt pay federal tax in is because I *overpaid* in ! Since they stole my tax records, they actually know that."
14565,Hypocritical megadouche!
14566,"Will visit IRS next time Im in DC just to say hi, since I paid the most taxes ever in history for an individual last year. Maybe I can have a cookie or something"
14567,True
14568,Seriously. How long must this go on?
14569,"Depends mostly on FAA certification, but hopefully within months. Were testing on Gulfstreams to debug issues, but deployment priority is commercial airliners."
14570,Cybertruck
14571,"Yes, in the air"
14572,Probably

14598,"I was at a lunch with Munger in where he told the whole table all the ways Tesla would fail. Made me quite sad, but I told him I agreed with all those reasons &amp; that we would probably die, but it was worth trying anyway."
14599,Some carmakers are trying hard
14600,[ahem]
14601,Ok
14602,No way
14603,Agreed. This has been broken for a long time.
14604,This will be real in our lifetime

14620,Now Tesla is worth a trilly willy!
14621,"Yup, we need to do that"

14632,Looming disaster for sure
14633,Good question!
14634,Human for scale
14635,Tower arms are lifting Starship onto Super Heavy Booster
14636,This would generate a lot of goodwill
14637,Much appreciated!
14638,Model X is an extremely difficult car to build. Most complex passenger car ever. Limiting factor is interior trim.
14639,We dropped the ball badly regarding new Model X production ramp &amp; still havent fully recovered. Was idiotic to stop production of old X in Dec when there was still plenty of demand!
14640,Pretty much
14641,"Thanks, this made a difference!"
14642,Tesla
14643,Yup!
14644,"Most news outlets attempt to answer the question: What are the worst things happening on Earth today? Its a big planet! Obviously, some bad things are happening somewhere at any given time, but focusing relentlessly on those does not give an accurate picture of reality."
14645,So hard to find out whats going on in the world without being bombarded with news that makes one sad &amp; angry!
14646,"True, careless negativity (destruction) is much harder than thoughtful positivity (creation)"
14647,Sadly true
14648,"Thats true to some degree, but citizen podcasts that arent negative like Rogan, Fridman, Dodd, TED interviews, etc are very popular. Maybe part of why traditional media outlets are so negative is because old habits die hard? They so rarely even try to be positive."
14649,Not needed
14650,Why is the traditional media such a relentless hatestream? Real question.
14651,Fate Irony
14652,It was so crazy! The insane tweet FUD campaign &amp; press hatestream of -2019 is still easily found.

14670,"We have to solve a huge part of AI just to make cars drive themselves. In retrospect, it was inevitable. The road system is designed for cameras (eyes) &amp; neural nets (brains)."
14671,Double-standard?
14672,Its not my money
14673,A bigger win than it may seem
14674,Yes
14675,Thursday next week at pm Texas time
14676,"Starship aspires to be the first fully reusable orbital launch vehicle, the holy grail of rocketry. This is the critical breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary."
14677,And all the forms of life on Earth
14678,Becoming multiplanetary is essential to extending dramatically the probable lifespan of civilization
14679,Starship is in a different league. Orders of magnitude more mass to orbit than Falcon. Necessary for creating a self-sustaining city on Mars.
14680,"If things go well, Falcon will launch about once a week on average in , delivering ~2/3 of all Earth payload to orbit"
14681,Tesla is working hard to provide more Megapacks for grid stabilization
14682,Congrats SpaceX Falcon team!
14683,Exactly. The terminology is anachronistic.
14684,"Who controls the memes, Controls the universe."
14685,Sigh
14686,High latitudes are operational probably this summer
14687,Haha seriously
14688,"SpaceX standard antenna production rises rapidly this year, so those with orders shouldnt have to wait long. Note, Starlink can only support a limited number of users in an area, so best to order early."
14689,Tunnels
14690,"Exciting progress at Starbase, Texas!"
14691,"bar is achievable, maybe even"
14692,This is twice the area of our standard phased array with broader scan angle
14693,Thanks for letting me know. Will be fixed soon.
14694,Thanks for the deep belly laugh
14695,Starlink high performance antenna
14696,"Will begin limited rollout to Canada this month. Safety is paramount, so we have to confirm no significant issues, given slightly different road rules."
14697,"Hes actually a lobbyist, not a journalist. There are many who pose as the latter while behaving like the former. No integrity. Indeed, there were no safety issues. The car simply slowed to ~2 mph &amp; continued forward if clear view with no cars or pedestrians."
14698,Yes
14699,Same
14700,Dragon hover test
14701,Will upload some videos tomorrow
14702,Harbinger battle on L is tough
14703,"Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company, both in car and in factory. This is not widely understood."
14704,"Tesla has great respect for software engineering, they do not"
14705,"story tall rocket, traveling several times faster than a bullet, backflips &amp; fires engines to return to launch site"
14706,Denmark just ended Covid restrictions
14707,"Theyve been writing bogus articles about Tesla (and me) for years. In the end, it is their own credibility that suffers."
14708,"Dave, I know youre a fan, but this is a silly question. I dont drive programs because I want to, but because I have to."
14709,Halo Infinite campaign is good
14710,"Im driving this program personally, as is the case for almost all new programs"
14711,"For reasons unknown, is unable to say the word Tesla"
14712,"If the government had the mandate of the people, there would be a significant counter-protest. There is not, therefore they do not."
14713,How many gene sequence changes to Covid-19 before it isnt Covid-19 anymore? OG Covid-19 ended a long time ago.
14714,Protesting in a Canadian winter shows real commitment!
14715,It would appear that the so-called fringe minority is actually the government
14716,So many Hitlers!
14717,A step in the right direction
14718,Great interviewer!
14719,"If Canadian government is suppressing peaceful protests, thats where fascism lies &amp; cartoonist is just a shill"
14720,Yup
14721,"Now that the big automotive advertisers are making EVs, you will see far fewer articles about EVs catching on fire. It is not surprising that internal combustion engine cars have a tendency to combust externally too."
14722,Just rewatched True Romance
14723,The ratio of machine to human compute skyrockets
14724,True
14725,Voters should call their elected politicians now to make it clear how they feel
14726,Lie back and think of Mars
14727,We need serious tonnage to Mars
14728,The Universe is a Hydrogen Sonata
14729,There are many faux
14730,It has been a very long road
14731,Interesting ideas
14732,There will only be EVs in the future
14733,Excited for future of solar at Tesla!
14734,Tesla will support FSD licensing by other manufacturers
14735,"Disney in the streets, Euphoria in the sheets"
14736,I have one
14737,"Given how hard insanely FSD is, I think it may take years or more before any company besides Tesla solves it"
14738,I have a feeling that the gerrymandering will not work as well as they think
14739,And in the darkness bind them
14740,"Honestly, I would let the border regions vote. Let the people there actually decide."
14741,Vote them out
14742,"If you scare people enough, they will demand removal of freedom. This is the path to tyranny."
14743,Seems odd that the UN still hasnt released world death rates
14744,Freedom is being stripped away one piece at a time until it is gone
14745,"Manganese also requires less lithium, as it operates at higher voltage"
14746,Just that manganese is an alternative to iron &amp; phosphorus for scaling cathode production to several TWh/year
14747,Exactly
14748,Your policies are directly responsible for the outrageously high insurance premiums paid by Californians
14749,You should be voted out of office
14750,CB radios are free from govt/media control
14751,Exactly
14752,I am in awe of Sweden
14753,Canadian truckers rule
14754,Biden is treating the American public like fools
14755,Biden is a damp puppet in human form
14756,I might have made it too pointy!

14758,Je maple syrup
14759,"Theyre being driven around in limousines, so they cant grok it"
14760,"Sounds about right for autonomous cars. Optimus will greatly exceed this. The economy will be as big as people want it to be. There will be no scarcity, except that which is artificially created."
14761,They appear to have some room for improvement
14762,Been driving latest Cybertruck prototype around Giga Texas. Its awesome!
14763,I have trouble understanding any other motivations tbh
14764,Nice
14765,Its like he could see the future!
14766,I will eat a happy meal on tv if accepts Dogecoin
14767,This is a matter of much internal debate
14768,Our biggest limitation with Fremont is convincing enough associates to build cars when they have so many other job opportunities in the Bay Area! Thanks again Tesla team for doing the hard work of building real products that people love
14769,I sense a trend
14770,Great wisdom
14771,Twitter is spending engineering resources on this bs while crypto scammers are throwing a spambot block party in every thread!?
14772,This is annoying
14773,"This is a hard thing for us to do right now, as we dont have enough satellites with laser links and there are already geo sats that serve the Tonga region. That is why Im asking for clear confirmation."
14774,"Yeah, this saves a whole tap. Just swipe down for auto navigate."
14775,Could people from Tonga let us know if it is important for SpaceX to send over Starlink terminals?
14776,wtf
14777,An SUV that is faster than a Formula race car
14778,Baby X is just like this haha
14779,Most people have no idea
14780,Yeah
14781,Maybe something like this
14782,Frank &amp; Beans
14783,Its true I do think a lot about rocket engine chamber pressure ahaha
14784,Same
14785,Ok
14786,But is he playing it on Legendary difficulty?
14787,Will do our best. Decentralized control of the robots will be critical.
14788,Sheer luck
14789,I hear versions of this often irl
14790,"Tesla AI might play a role in AGI, given that it trains against the outside world, especially with the advent of Optimus"
14791,Believe in the future!
14792,Back to the moon soon
14793,Another Starlinks reach orbit
14794,I was just there. Good progress!
14795,People do not yet understand how valuable an autonomous vehicle will be
14796,"Last year, Japan had ~800k births &amp; life expectancy is years (impressively high!), implying future population of only M, dropping almost half from current population of M. Thats a lot of ghost towns &amp; cities."
14797,Tragic case of ego/ability&gt;&gt;1
14798,"If there arent enough people for Earth, then there definitely wont be enough for Mars"
14799,Trying to set a good example
14800,Exactly
14801,"UN projections are utter nonsense. Just multiply last years births by life expectancy. Given downward trend in birth rate, that is best case unless reversed."
14802,We should be much more worried about population collapse
14803,I see where Frank Herbert got some of his ideas
14804,Yup
14805,Honestly I woulda clicked it
14806,"Spatial &amp; temporal memory are improving, so there will be less flicker"
14807,"Yeah, unfortunately this is becoming a security issue"
14808,"Cool, were both born days after /20 haha"
14809,"I obv cant comment on every rumor, but this isnt true. Am headed to Berlin mid Feb, not this week."
14810,Pretty wild
14811,The most entertaining outcome is the most likely
14812,Accurate video
14813,going out later this week
14814,Indeed
14815,Yeah
14816,We will start rolling out FSD beta in Canada cautiously in next to weeks
14817,Good thing I never tweet anything controversial
14818,Green Hills software is a pile of trash. Linux ftw.
14819,It is heartening to see the rise of individualist vs corporate media
14820,"In theory, it saves landing leg mass &amp; enables immediate reflight of an otherwise unwieldy, giant rocket"
14821,Correct
14822,Good campaign
14823,There sure are a lot of interesting ways to arrange pixels

14831,Big difference
14832,Birds are a myth
14833,Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin
14834,"Yeah, doesnt make sense"
14835,Almost all input is error. Car should do the right thing automatically.
14836,Dojo
14837,Yup
14838,Turns out yes
14839,Still working through a lot of challenges with the government
14840,Great explanation!
14841,He was truly exceptional
14842,Bizarre anti-environment move by govt of California
14843,"Tesla is working as fast as possible to support Tesla owners worldwide. Sustainable energy affects everyone on Earth, as we all share one atmosphere."
14844,Accurate
14845,Most people have no idea how fast sustainable energy is growing!
14846,"If the alarming collapse in birth rate continues, civilization will indeed die with a whimper in adult diapers"
14847,Mind-blowing that over % of humans have a smart phone
14848,Starship launch &amp; catch tower
14849,"Its our best car ever, along with the Plaid X"
14850,"It was a mistake to try to use the Elise. In the end, only ~5% of the Elise parts ended up being used. Tesla Roadster is a totally different car."
14851,Monthly subscription price will rise when FSD goes to wide release
14852,FSD price will rise as we get closer to FSD production code release
14853,Just in the US
14854,Tesla FSD price rising to $12k on Jan
14855,Beta should be ready in about a week. Beta with single city/highway software stack &amp; many other architectural upgrades probably next month.
14856,Starlinks with lasers deployed to orbit
14857,Masters of Doom is a great book
14858,nice
14859,Room to improve
14860,Earth should be called Water
14861,Tonnage to orbit is the more fundamental metric
14862,Absolutely. This is just bad math.
14863,Yes
14864,Raptor now operates routinely at bar main chamber pressure
14865,Reminds me of when I hex edited Ultima V to get out of the final maze
14866,Yay Switzerland!!
14867,There is no way to be in touch with voters when youre three generations away from voting age
14868,Lets make the roaring s happen!
14869,Great work by Tesla team worldwide!
14870,"This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Moms cousins farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford."
14871,"This person blocked me, so cant read the tweet. Whats their deal?"
14872,"We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy he is greatly missed). My Dad provided % of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round wouldve happened anyway."
14873,"He didnt own an emerald mine &amp; I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldnt even afford a nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night &amp; website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?"
14874,Pretty much
14875,Federal
14876,Probably . Depends on regulatory approvals.
14877,Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of . Def by .
14878,"Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For close stars, a laser sail is good too."
14879,"Yes, but its too secret"
14880,Hopefully fully operational in
14881,"Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects"
14882,"No, hes still much faster"
14883,"These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them."
14884,Done by dawn
14885,That would be a fringe benefit
14886,"Build super safe, Earthquake-proof tunnels under cities to solve traffic"
14887,Flight is hopefully to months away
14888,"Were now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0."
14889,Was up all night with SpaceX team working on Starship tank dome production (most difficult part of primary structure). Dawn arrives
14890,Please stop spamming bleak links into a paywall
14891,Ok
14892,Activating engine two
14893,It is an honor &amp; a privilege to work with so many great engineers
14894,The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
14895,"Its not that these things cant be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."
14896,Future feature
14897,"Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all."
14898,"Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someones on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in + countries results in many corner cases!"
14899,"Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."
14900,Were building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
14901,Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
14902,Most people still dont know its there
14903,"Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar"
14904,"If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"
14905,Merry Christmas Hope youre enjoying latest software update!
14906,Yer welcome son
14907,"Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar, should do work in morning &amp; home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled)."
14908,That is odd. Try pressing both scroll wheel buttons to reboot. Have forwarded this to service.
14909,No
14910,Coming soon
14911,They should double down on insanity of Cats. Right move.
14912,Black Mirror
14913,Parasite
14914,True
14915,Needs improvement
14916,Yes
14917,He was awesome. I squared R heating is why room temp superconductors arent needed to carry power long distances efficiently. Just jack up voltage.
14918,stock art
14919,Whoa the stock is so high lol
14920,"Big communication penalty for remote work, which means the gain in talent that wont move has to be very high"
14921,Truth
14922,"Wow, accurate analysis!"
14923,Good point
14924,Ok
14925,Dont wanna brag but was me
14926,Henry Cavill +1
14927,Also fake Soundcloud rapper
14928,Write games
14929,Yes
14930,"Regarding .X to hardware update, that should happen in earnest in Q1. Software feature delta was zero until now, so not much point in doing it before then."
14931,"Pretty much, although if there was a way to spend money to solve software problems sooner, Id love it. The real constraint is finding great software engineers."
14932,Ok sure
14933,Sorry for the delay on V2.X! We just couldnt get it all done in time.
14934,"Unfortunately, this has been necessary for many years, but hopefully not forever"
14935,"Sorry, its been a bit of a struggle. Software team has been working all weekend to resolve last minute issues. Hopefully starts rolling out tonight."
14936,"My wiki is a war zone with a zillion edits. At least its obviously not curated! Some day, I should probably write what *my* fictionalized version of reality is"
14937,Yes
14938,"Started Zip2 with ~$2k &amp; ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into X/PayPal, rolled proceeds again into SpaceX/Tesla, but these are all companies where I played fundamental founding role. Not right to ask others to put in money if I dont put in mine."
14939,"If Tesla &amp; SpaceX go bankrupt, so will I. As it should be."
14940,"Just looked at my wiki for st time in years. Its insane! Btw, can someone please delete investor. I do basically zero investing."
14941,Pre VFX cut would be $$$$
14942,Another milestone
14943,Sending you healing vibes
14944,"Thats certainly our impression, but its an old version of Tesla software, so effect is limited"
14945,In-house
14946,The real reason for Looper was to travel back in time &amp; stop a terrible calamity the premiere of Cats!
14947,For sure
14948,Great show
14949,Holiday gift ideas
14950,Were working on moving more cars to Florida. End of year delivery is intense! Very proud of Tesla team for all their hard work.
14951,Ok
14952,Yes
14953,Ok
14954,Its been years
14955,I try so hard with these jokes!
14956,Starfleet begins
14957,For sure!
14958,Orbit is hard. Best wishes for landing &amp; swift recovery to next mission.
14959,Does it like the smiths?
14960,"Needs a few more days of validation, then early access, then wide release"
14961,"Tesla holiday software update has FSD sneak preview, Stardew Valley, Lost Backgammon &amp; a few other things"
14962,You dont hear much about element
14963,"No, as thats OG Mobileye hardware"
14964,Cinnamon toast crunch
14965,"This is quite a thorny hardware problem, as there are many diff versions of mcu &amp; autopilot computer &amp; supporting hardware. Cars last so much longer than phones! Hopefully able to upgrade mcu1 &amp; ap2.0 in a few months."
14966,This mode will show pic of moth &amp; play the smiths
14967,Lmpe
14968,Tesla Moth Mode (better late than never)
14969,"Yes, just costs a few thousand dollars &amp; is more complex than a board swap. Bunch of connectors &amp; antennas need to change. We can improve the speed a little with software optimization, which might be enough."
14970,I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
14971,This is a great meme
14972,MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isnt needed for full self-driving &amp; cost is ~$2k for limited entertainment improvements.
14973,"Never trust cynics, as they excuse their own bad deeds by telling themselves everyone does it"
14974,"Yes, probably &amp; partially"
14975,Some good ideas here!
14976,"Telemetry indicates soft touchdown on the water, so fairing might still be reusable"
14977,Sigh
14978,"Possibly Excession, but Id recommend reading Player of Games &amp; Surface Detail first. Theyre all great."
14979,Yes
14980,Raptor is making great progress! Just finished an engineering review with SpaceX Propulsion. Engine SN is about to ship to McGregor with some holiday style
14981,Age of Napoleon is excellent
14982,This is how we will view fossil fuel cars
14983,Crossing S-curves standard for tech transitions
14984,Nice to meet you
14985,Baby Yoda
14986,We are literally a brain in a vat. The vat is your skull. Everything you think is real is an electrical signal. Feels so real though.
14987,"Games only render what you look at when you look at it, as the compute load would otherwise be impossibly high. Until observed, objects are a probability function, aka quantum mechanics."
14988,Blame Minecraft
14989,smol puppy math
14990,Plausible
14991,Meant to say is render speed. Frame rate is locked.
14992,There are type of people: those who understand binary &amp; those who dont. And those who werent expecting a ternary joke.
14993,Your DLC is $$$$
14994,Way too many paywalls &amp; spawn points
14995,"Seriously, the NPC dialog tree should have more options"
14996,Just Read the Instructions
14997,Of course
14998,"If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing &amp; the tutorial is way too long"
14999,Sure
15000,Root of energy to mass ratio is max render speed of the simulation
15001,Math jokes have a small audience
15002,Kids these days have no respect!
15003,Thats the one!
15004,It really does
15005,"They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! Its pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars."
15006,"Yeah, i that I bought in for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the speed transmission failed."
15007,"Couldnt afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, thats me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol."
15008,Maybe on Starship? Its def got the payload capacity
15009,Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
15010,"Yeah, its one of my favorite T-shirts!"
15011,"Well aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We wont do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was ."
15012,Your Twitter comments are great btw!
15013,Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. Its better because of you!
15014,"This may sound crazy, but asking real people what theyd like in a product is a great way to meet their needs"
15015,There will be no loss of either
15016,"That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width"
15017,"True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages."
15018,We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by + inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
15019,Speed solves everything
15020,"Hes def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a by mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs"
15021,"Super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great &amp; costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels!"
15022,Huge admiration &amp; respect for the Tesla China team. Their talent &amp; drive is amazing!
15023,For sure
15024,"If we create a city on Mars, Earth-Mars travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive"
15025,Launching third flight of this Dragon spacecraft to tomorrow
15026,Yes
15027,"After a while, hydrogen became sentient"
15028,"Bravo, right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal."
15029,"People often think theyre breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O &amp; a dash of neon &amp; krypton (etc.)"
15030,"Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement"
15031,Still cant believe how hard it was to get !
15032,We sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us &amp; then he said yes
15033,"Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us!"
15034,Its artificial
15035,Do you like our owl?
15036,"Overall shape is good for low drag coefficient. Matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges &amp; guide air around wheels, like an invisible sculpture."
15037,Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated
15038,Thats why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control
15039,"Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel."
15040,They are dead to me
15041,Its a generational thing
15042,"With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details."
15043,Touch
15044,Just because he has a flamethrower and I have a flamethrower doesnt mean um ok fine Im Hank Scorpio
15045,This one is deep. Happy Thanksgiving!
15046,The finest in apocalypse protection technology! Flamethrower optional.
15047,Def not dainty
15048,"Yes, Cybertruck will have steel balls"
15049,k
15050,Wed be happy to help
15051,"Sure, will aim to do this next week"
15052,"Agreed, this will be exciting to see!"
15053,"Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation."
15054,Bring it on
15055,Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!
15056,k
15057,"Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didnt bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time"
15058,Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill
15059,"Higher hardness, higher strength &amp; doesnt cost crazy money for ~3mm skins"
15060,"In general, this is something Tesla should do"
15061,We should def make it good to hang out there
15062,"Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year"
15063,"Good question. Its a new variant of series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press."
15064,Can be wrapped in any color!
15065,The body panels will actually be laser cut!
15066,"Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too"
15067,Interesting idea
15068,True
15069,Really? Ok sure.
15070,Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
15071,"Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then Im confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count."
15072,Study the Blade!!
15073,"Were creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but well need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it cant be made using standard methods."
15074,"Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled X stainless is much stronger."
15075,"Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made"
15076,"Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you cant stamp ultra-hard X steel, because it breaks the stamping press"
15077,Excellent review by Marques!
15078,k
15079,Yes
15080,Haha v true
15081,With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement
15082,"k Cybertruck orders so far, with % choosing dual, % tri &amp; % single motor"
15083,Great analysis
15084,That would be cool
15085,Gonna have some sick attachments
15086,Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)
15087,Riding in the Cybertruck
15088,Sure
15089,Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha.
15090,Syd Mead
15091,We threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event &amp; didnt even scratch the glass!
15092,"Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche . Order Cybertruck online at"
15093,Yes
15094,"Will be an option to add solar power that generates miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate to miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is ."
15095,Tesla person electric ATV will come at first as an option for Cybertruck
15096,See ya in
15097,Nobody *expects* the Cybertruck
15098,Yup
15099,Haha
15100,High time we had a Tesla coil!
15101,Cybertruck design influenced partly by The Spy Who Loved Me
15102,Coming soon! Were working to complete the full Supercharger route from London to Shanghai.
15103,Tesla Cybertruck (pressurized edition) will be official truck of Mars
15104,Of course
15105,Fun party guaranteed!
15106,Long journey
15107,Tonight
15108,"Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different."
15109,Maybe wont need a key at all
15110,"So many reporters gave Chanos airtime when he called Tesla a worthless fraud. Now that he has been proven wrong, silence"
15111,Gravitas is overrated
15112,That would be cool
15113,"National Science Foundation, u should add a W to ur name. Would get way more clicks. Ur welcome."
15114,% of people want to gentrify Mordor
15115,The China space industry is very impressive
15116,Cephalopods have a strange intelligence
15117,It certainly does
15118,True
15119,Not sure. Maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?
15120,"Even Toyota, who made the Prius. That is sad."
15121,Guess I was obsessed with space from an early age. Fair point.
15122,Id be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. Its like a kids drawing.
15123,"Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too."
15124,Exactly! Well said.
15125,Surprisingly common
15126,Cybertruck unveil Thursday night
15127,Innovation comes in many ways
15128,Meaning not fair that Boeing gets so much more for the same thing
15129,This doesnt seem right
15130,True
15131,Semi-infinite
15132,Seems likely. = hipsters.
15133,"Right now, trajectory of neuro-silicon symbiosis doesnt appear to intersect trajectory of AGI. Goal of Neuralink is to raise this probability above %."
15134,We fought the Balrog last year
15135,Gentrify Mordor?
15136,It was Tacheles
15137,Memes are modern art
15138,F8 irony
15139,There will be many opportunities for both new &amp; experienced people!
15140,fomo yolo
15141,"Yeah, makes sense"
15142,Congrats to Tesla team on Model winning best midsize car in Germany!
15143,"Will build batteries, powertrains &amp; vehicles, starting with Model Y"
15144,GIGA BERLIN
15145,Congratulations!
15146,Starlink vertical on the pad
15147,Yes
15148,Haha
15149,Exactly
15150,"Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species"
15151,Bad logic is always ugly
15152,Same goes for digital super intelligence denial
15153,MPGe!
15154,Yes
15155,Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
15156,"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as tons/year."
15157,"Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldnt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine , although probably engines + can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
15158,Pretty much
15159,"Exactly! Its also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
15160,"No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. Thats the sales pitch. Want to go?"
15161,"So it will take about years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
15162,As the planets align only once every two years
15163,A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
15164,No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is whats hard.
15165,"Current global payload to orbit capacity is about tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
15166,"If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does tons to orbit, thats a capacity of million tons of payload to orbit per year"
15167,"Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as its designed to fly X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
15168,The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
15169,Gas/diesel cars too
15170,True
15171,Extremism is so fun! ()
15172,Of course!
15173,Yes
15174,The date is strangely familiar
15175,Cybertruck unveil on Nov in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
15176,Looking into it
15177,Yes
15178,"The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF"
15179,Naturally
15180,This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called Pitch Day &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They dont buy APCs. Its the Air Force.
15181,Fair point. Coming soon. Were making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. FA right after that.
15182,"Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
15183,More to come
15184,Yes
15185,Would be odd to expect anything else
15186,"That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
15187,"Wow, seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every hours. No boats needed."
15188,Great poem
15189,"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, weve only done multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so more left to reach successful tests in a row."
15190,"Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called Low Gear!"
15191,Tesla Solarglass vs Happy Halloween!!
15192,"Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong"
15193,"Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, theres a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in to &amp; /4 mile races."
15194,Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
15195,Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar!
15196,Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
15197,The fires are all too real
15198,Haha true
15199,snacks
15200,"Hard to say with high accuracy, but to weeks is my best guess"
15201,"Soon, SpaceX will launch astronauts to !"
15202,Thats significantly improved in current production
15203,"True, my name literally means tree"
15204,"If you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if youre home &amp; to home if at work. Not sure if thats in wide release yet, but def in early access. Its an awesome feature."
15205,Just a reminder that the Tesla Full Self-Driving option goes up by $1000 at midnight on Nov for all regions that have Smart Summon. Order your car online at .
15206,"I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill."
15207,For Treebeard
15208,"Ok, sounds legit, will donate M trees"
15209,Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
15210,Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
15211,"Were changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc"
15212,"Very true. Glass doesnt burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs."
15213,I hate advertising
15214,"Unfortunately, its hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to to add solar to an existing roof &amp; for a new roof with integrated solar."
15215,"We dont make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot"
15216,"If youre directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today"
15217,"Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires"
15218,So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
15219,"Homes with solar sell for % more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important."
15220,Id recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
15221,Extremely high
15222,Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters
15223,"US clean energy incentive drops by % on Jan , so orders must be received by roughly Nov to be installed in time"
15224,Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery backup for /7 clean energy &amp; no blackouts at
15225,Sure
15226,Took my son to play piano for the seniors home in Pasadena. It was lovely to see them smile
15227,Thanks to everyone at Tesla who worked so hard over the years to make our Fremont factory successful!
15228,Sandwich time travel is the only explanation
15229,Physics facts
15230,"Yes, you can walk on the Tesla Solarglass roof. In stilettos, if you want"
15231,Jerome is great! Tesla team in general is the strongest its ever been.
15232,"Yes, wight destruction guaranteed or your money back!"
15233,Tesla Solarglass roof
15234,Will start at ~2:15. Sorry for slight delay.
15235,Haha true
15236,Srsly
15237,Transparent aluminum is a real thing!
15238,"That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!"
15239,"Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!"
15240,"Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly."
15241,"Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth."
15242,"To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended"
15243,California time
15244,"This product may appear simple, but actually *very* difficult to get right"
15245,Will do an open call Q&amp;A
15246,Major FUD incoming for sure haha
15247,"I have V1, but will switch to V3"
15248,Tesla Solar Tile Roof V3 launch tomorrow at pm
15249,Sure
15250,But actually
15251,Super proud of Tesla team for great execution &amp; support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!!
15252,Tesla Q3 results: - Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule - Model Y ahead of schedule - Solar installs +48% from Q2 - GAAP profitable - Positive free cash flow
15253,The big rear wing is only on for one day for rear downforce calibration. Isnt needed to set ring record &amp; wont be in the production car.
15254,"Internal camera isnt used yet (meant for robotaxi), but thats a good idea"
15255,Please lmk about your experience and what can be improved
15256,Coming soon
15257,"Whoa, it worked!!"
15258,Sending this tweet through space via Starlink satellite
15259,"Homes with solar sell for % more, according to Zillow"
15260,"More carrot, less stick"
15261,"Very likely that a home with clean power thats lower cost than utility, plus blackout protection via Powerwall, will have a positive effect on value"
15262,PG&amp;E says rolling blackouts expected in California for next years!
15263,Order Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery for /7 clean power &amp; no blackouts!
15264,Going offline for a few days
15265,Both at the same time!
15266,More about dealing with failure modes &amp; roll control
15267,"Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesnt solve roll control well."
15268,"Common myth, but incorrect"
15269,And so begins the robocalypse
15270,Tesla wins best headlights award
15271,"The final configuration used at Nrburgring to set the record will go into production around summer , so this is not merely for the track"
15272,Anyone whos interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. Were gonna take this to a whole new level!
15273,Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. Im in awe.
15274,"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. Its insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you"
15275,"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing Ive ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
15276,"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
15277,And the lead character is also named Woody
15278,"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
15279,Conservation of energy tells you the answer
15280,Looking forward to Kerbal !
15281,"We def could be wrong about this, but its actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Dont need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower."
15282,"Also, were keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so thats leaving a lot on the table"
15283,"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe to sec."
15284,"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; . Target is ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
15285,Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.
15286,"This is true. All that matters is number used in v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass."
15287,"Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
15288,"Were working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that arent actual parking spaces."
15289,"Yeah, great team!"
15290,"To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth."
15291,"Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
15292,"Most people arent aware that orbit (and zero gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about times the speed of sound to stay in space."
15293,"Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly"
15294,Software
15295,Yes
15296,Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
15297,Venus would be very difficult
15298,True
15299,"Yes, we will"
15300,"It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers."
15301,"Deep Rain neural net coming soon. Were not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep."
15302,"Yep, good catch"
15303,hot pot
15304,Cybertruck doesnt look like anything Ive seen bouncing around the Internet. Its closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.
15305,Those rumors are false
15306,Coming v soon
15307,Haha
15308,Ms. Chief &amp; Ms. Tree
15309,lol
15310,Space Jam shouldve won the Oscar
15311,Recommended for sure. Both movies are incredible.
15312,"First will rewatch Godfather Part II, then Space Jam"
15313,"Underappreciated , will watch!"
15314,Is Space Jam good?
15315,So it goes
15316,Sure looks that way
15317,Nice
15318,Solar
15319,"Depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so to MW as a rough guess"
15320,"Whoa, that does look good!"
15321,Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.
15322,French fries are the devil
15323,"., are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?"
15324,Super messed up situation!
15325,Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
15326,Should be much better at this point
15327,Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
15328,"Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry"
15329,"Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist."
15330,Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
15331,"V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
15332,"When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, youll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car."
15333,Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing thats problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
15334,"Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
15335,"Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why theres a delay. Other countries are supportive."
15336,"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov"
15337,Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for /7 clean power &amp; no more blackouts!
15338,Will be throughout Canada
15339,Its something special
15340,Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future
15341,True
15342,I Asterix &amp; Obelix!
15343,Exactly
15344,Ok
15345,Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is /7 clean power with no blackouts.
15346,All Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits.
15347,Sooo annoying!!
15348,Were changing Powerwall Storm Watch to Disaster Watch. Covers more bases.
15349,Yes
15350,No change
15351,Important for Moonbase Alpha!
15352,Working on it
15353,Even Gary likes it!
15354,Its really quite fun!
15355,"But we call it caraoke, because its in a"
15356,Tesla software V10.0 comes with karaoke
15357,Yes
15358,A Shortfall of Gravitas
15359,Next update
15360,"siq burn, Gary, siq burn"
15361,Why is there no emoji for dignity!!
15362,Yes
15363,Door hinge
15364,the color orange is named after the fruit
15365,Will remove
15366,Thanks for mentioning. Should be enabled on all loaner cars.
15367,Yeah
15368,"Not easily, as requires wire harness changes"
15369,Im in the credits
15370,Worth reading Human Compatible by Stuart Russell (hes great!) about future AI risks &amp; solutions
15371,All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
15372,"We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up &amp; received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. Were focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts."
15373,"For what its worth, the SpaceX schedule, which Ive just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon &amp; Dragon at the Cape &amp; all testing done in ~10 weeks"
15374,Culture Class is really something
15375,I hope so
15376,Were doomed!
15377,Hh
15378,Haha true
15379,Done
15380,Trouble!
15381,And thats just the tip of the iceberg
15382,Agreed
15383,Good ones
15384,"Agreed, fair point"
15385,Any feature requests?
15386,"Given how quickly the world is shifting to electric vehicles, a gas/diesel vehicle bought today will probably have low resale value"
15387,"&amp; sounds too (also, of course)"
15388,Will consider
15389,Sure
15390,"Customized horn &amp; movement sounds (coconuts being one, of course) coming to Teslas soon"
15391,Haha
15392,We will understand the next question
15393,True
15394,To understand the nature of consciousness
15395,Its true
15396,Exactly
15397,Great list of hotel hacks in this thread!
15398,Excited about launching asteroid defense mission!
15399,Lets go boyz!
15400,Sorry it took so long!
15401,"Wow, cool! Summon will get steadily smoother until its like an expert chauffeur who knows you well."
15402,Welded steel
15403,Probably Starlink &amp; some fun things
15404,Rosetta by Vangelis is incredible
15405,"Not sure, will ask regulators"
15406,Enhanced should get it too
15407,Aiming for this weekend!
15408,"Hopefully, a month or two, although it may be a little silly at first"
15409,Not yet
15410,First point release update expected to go out this weekend
15411,Over Tesla Smart Summon uses in first few days!
15412,"Thanks, Tesla team is the strongest its ever been &amp; doing an amazing job! Honored to work beside them."
15413,"If km works, then orbit"
15414,Great summary of the key points!
15415,"Thats about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot &amp; have to be replaced."
15416,"Its all the secondary structure that concerns me, not engines &amp; primary airframe"
15417,"Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is &lt;$250k for V2.0 is a ton thrust-optimized engine, ie &lt;$1000/ton"
15418,Stop sending me this
15419,Agreed &amp; such a heartwarming photo
15420,I have that exact thought every time I get the flu
15421,Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
15422,Lot of ways to melt &amp; join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently &amp; with precise parts.
15423,Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right &amp; not needed with steel.
15424,"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see"
15425,Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back
15426,Haha yes
15427,"In solving for a good Mars climate, we will learn a great deal about how to do so on Earth. It is the inverse problem."
15428,Inside Starship cargo bay. Header tanks mounted in tip of nosecone to offset engine weight at rear.
15429,Cool video!
15430,"Probably our most viral feature ever. Most of the Autopilot team has been working on this, led by Ashok, CJ, Andrej &amp; many others."
15431,Good question
15432,"Rage, rage against the dying of the light"
15433,"Were going to use the pedestrian pink noise speaker to talk to people &amp; create customized horn sounds. I beg your pardon, but would you be so kind as to allow me to proceed? Said in the voice of Mr. Darcy."
15434,"Special light pattern (but not hazards, as theyre too shrill) seems right"
15435,Makes sense
15436,Precisely
15437,To make life as we know it multiplanetary
15438,Starship will allow us to inhabit other worlds
15439,Starship halves being joined
15440,Summon is improving rapidly
15441,"Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco +. If anyone has ++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing &amp; machining of Raptor far more than in design of the engine itself!"
15442,Theres so much power going through this engine that its close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
15443,Yes
15444,"Well, hopefully closer to bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it."
15445,"No, weve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above is nice to have &amp; well get around to it, but not needed for flight."
15446,Probably around or pm
15447,"What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber &amp; nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over bar or ~12,000 psi"
15448,Figure of speech
15449,"Meanwhile, back in reality"
15450,Media report was false
15451,Raptor uses milled copper channels with an inconel jacket all the way down
15452,Three Raptors on a Starship
15453,Always
15454,"Wow, its been years since we started at Boca!"
15455,"About a week. Will include slight improvements, based on initial user feedback."
15456,"We look for rare corner case issues with a limited release US build, then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities. So, soon, but hard to say exactly."
15457,"Gary, you rock!"
15458,Tesla V10.0 just started rolling out to all US Tesla owners with FSD option &amp; advanced download selected in vehicle software settings
15459,More like
15460,"Anonymous bot swarms deserve a closer examination. If theyre evolving rapidly, somethings up."
15461,"If advanced AI (beyond basic bots) hasnt been applied to manipulate social media, it wont be long before it is"
15462,Exactly
15463,That would be a nice touch
15464,"This is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so"
15465,Haha awesome
15466,We could probably do that
15467,m
15468,"Not sure we could go quite that tight, but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at users discretion"
15469,"With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They dont stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great."
15470,"Mk1 ship is around tons dry &amp; tons wet, but aiming for by Mk4 or Mk5. Total stack mass with max payload is tons."
15471,Absolutely
15472,Youre welcome! Feature requests always appreciated.
15473,"Six. Two windward, one under each fin &amp; two leeward. Provides redundancy for landing on unimproved surfaces."
15474,On the transporter
15475,Lifting lower section of Starship
15476,Exactly
15477,Impressive work by Chad &amp; Steve!
15478,"Almost entirely C++, but we did have an (advanced for the time) client-side Java app for viewing maps &amp; (weirdly) a D hockey game in VRML"
15479,Turbo Pascal
15480,"Mostly C/C++, Python &amp; SQL"
15481,It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
15482,"This includes original engineering of new factory processes &amp; cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization."
15483,"Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car"
15484,"For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise."
15485,"Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust"
15486,"Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing."
15487,"Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."
15488,"It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating"
15489,"Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the th."
15490,"Thats correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver."
15491,"Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what its worth, he has my support."
15492,Just sent a note to check
15493,Some secrets are too dangerous to be free
15494,"Between the trees and the forest floor, its like a giant mural, continued the veritable High Priest of the Harvest Season, adding that he would soon have to rake his driveway, an activity for which he will most certainly don a cashmere scarf."
15495,"Hoping to open in Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia &amp; most of Eastern Europe early next year. Finally, we will do Nikola Tesla proud by having his cars in his countries of origin!"
15496,OG Roadster is def helping us out here with M miles by itself
15497,Ahem well um
15498,"Classified as a URO, unidentified road object (from Area )"
15499,"SpaceX Foundry is used exclusively for advanced alloys/shapes for Raptor, incl our superalloy, SX500"
15500,Bottom half of Starship at night. Top half with forward fins &amp; header tanks probably stacks on Wednesday. Three Raptors already installed.
15501,Raceway &amp; flap hinge aero covers
15502,Just leaving SpaceX Starship build site in Boca
15503,"Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon , but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver."
15504,Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
15505,"For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure."
15506,"Current analysis, which Im not fully bought into, suggests that rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
15507,"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward fin would simply be used as a leg."
15508,Stability is not an issue with
15509,"Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom."
15510,"Yes. Theres a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we havent closed it out."
15511,"Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica, Texas"
15512,Thanks!
15513,"Either way, sustainable energy wins!!"
15514,srsly
15515,Its my glasses
15516,"Sure. Have to do it on Mars from beginning. Will ultimately do that on Earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term."
15517,Next quarter
15518,"Will discuss with my product team next week, but probably"
15519,Yes
15520,Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. The Apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem!
15521,A year old who has better reasoning &amp; more heart than the vast majority of political leaders
15522,Thats what life was like back in
15523,You have been warned
15524,"No, its one integrated release"
15525,"Fixing several minor bugs &amp; a regression in highway driving, so probably early to mid next week"
15526,Much better chess engine coming
15527,Well said
15528,Very meaningful action by the company that invented the internal combustion engine. People will remember this day. Respect.
15529,Electric is the future! Congratulations Daimler!!
15530,Nice compression
15531,"And of course, this one, but thats obv"
15532,e^ + =
15533,"For some reason, I always loved this formula"
15534,Whoa cool
15535,Smart Summon will work on all v2.0+ hardware in wide release
15536,"L'Ambroisie, Place des Vosges"
15537,Nice
15538,"Amazingly, this is not an Onion article"
15539,Je ne regrette Etienne
15540,Lane offset should be much better in V10.0
15541,Yes
15542,Told you AI was dangerous!!
15543,In other news
15544,Busted
15545,"A little, but this is mostly a design update for those interested"
15546,Haha
15547,Apollo
15548,Landing leg frame
15549,Yes
15550,Glad youre ok!
15551,You never know
15552,Exactly
15553,"Actually, Model would beat the Taycan on Nrburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range"
15554,"No, but very close"
15555,"Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys &amp; Talulah in the seat Model S several years ago."
15556,Absolutely
15557,New Roadster and X will come later
15558,"No, original forward facing seats plus rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before."
15559,Its a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.
15560,"Thanks, I will stop by on the th!"
15561,"Theyre available through the app, but we need to make them easier to find"
15562,Area of Area
15563,"Droid Junkyard, Tatooine"
15564,Absolutely
15565,"Feeling Lucky (Google tribute!) or Hungry are % intended for max enjoyment of Tesla owner. If location has destination chargers, thats a plus, but car should only route there if location is great. This will be hit &amp; miss initially, but should hone towards excellent over time."
15566,Great conversation-starter!
15567,Damn
15568,I want this T-shirt!
15569,"Service center expansion is at max speed, so yes"
15570,"Sure, Im planning on meeting community supporters around the presentation on the th. Thanks!"
15571,Maybe we can buffer enough of it onboard. Will check.
15572,Starship Team
15573,Thats what we believe is highly likely
15574,"I visiting Boca Chica, Brownsville &amp; Texas in general! Thanks for all your support!!"
15575,Getting close
15576,"Yes, coming soon"
15577,Oh that would be fun. Will see.
15578,Joe Mode is the best mode
15579,Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!!
15580,Wise words from Gary the Bot
15581,"However, we wont customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense."
15582,Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally secs if you use Apple Pay at .
15583,"Exactly! Weve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide."
15584,"Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we dont raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
15585,"Thats not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why Im looking into it"
15586,"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
15587,"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
15588,Agreed
15589,"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
15590,"There arent really meant to be Tesla incentives, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
15591,"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
15592,"Hopefully, next year"
15593,"Personally, I think the universe looks great for billion years, let alone"
15594,Sagan was awesome
15595,They used to have butt bellows for blowing smoke up your along the Thames River in London
15596,Haha exactly!
15597,Yes
15598,"Yes, thats exactly what I meant, Gary the Bot!"
15599,Tesla commercial solar ordering now live at !
15600,At least they had great cigars
15601,Ahem
15602,A Speedraptor is a Velociraptor with no sense of direction (thats how you can them apart)
15603,This is technically a Speedraptor
15604,"Autopilot active crash prevention keeps getting better, as we examine every crash for improvement &amp; then upload smarter software. Ironically, I hope were never on the list!"
15605,v^2/r is fun haha
15606,"Makes it clear that you can only sense acceleration, not velocity"
15607,The downward spiral
15608,Good point
15609,To carry people
15610,Model S at Nrburgring has seats
15611,All great! Mel Brooks
15612,Spaceballs
15613,Flux capacitor option package
15614,Yes
15615,Soon
15616,"Yes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production &amp; applies to S,X &amp; Roadster, but not or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors."
15617,No
15618,The only thing beyond Ludicrous is Plaid
15619,A Flock of Bricks
15620,Next year
15621,Cuphead
15622,Of course
15623,Polytopia
15624,This could be good
15625,"But we probably wont try for best lap time this week, as we need to review &amp; tune Model S thoroughly for safety on Nrburgring, especially Flugplatz section"
15626,Model S is already there
15627,"Model S just set record for fastest door ever at Laguna Seca, video tmrw"
15628,DMT FTW
15629,Getting ready for flight of orbit-class Starship design
15630,Aargh!!
15631,"No, but that was an epic piece at a time when the word was being overrun by demented versions of an otherwise delightful jam container. It was like World War Z, but mason jars"
15632,Id love to
15633,obv
15634,For sure!
15635,sland
15636,Will be answered on th
15637,Exactly
15638,Looks good
15639,The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they wont fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.
15640,"The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
15641,"Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
15642,Precisely
15643,"Distance from fireball is *a*t^2, so if t is small, you havent moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, youll only travel ~0.03m in ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, youre prob ok."
15644,You know destination weather before departure &amp; theres no weather in space
15645,Everything happens so fast. Its such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels km in mins.
15646,"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
15647,"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but thats not indicative of capability."
15648,"Over time, &amp; are possible, but very difficult"
15649,Most likely
15650,Photoshop is amazing
15651,"Sea level Raptors vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle"
15652,For sure
15653,Actually true
15654,"Ceres, Callisto, Ganymede &amp; Titan"
15655,And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
15656,Deep lore
15657,Hoping to open in Romania soon!
15658,Definitely
15659,Probability that were in base Polytopia is highly unlikely - KWM
15660,Wow cool
15661,Why arent more people talking about this!?
15662,Sounds about right
15663,Its not
15664,"Over time, it will be % sustainable"
15665,Hadouken!!
15666,"Offer me money, offer me power"
15667,Also
15668,"Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!)"
15669,"For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains."
15670,Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.
15671,"Very exciting to see Indias rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall."
15672,Yes
15673,"Thanks for offering! Sure, that would be great."
15674,We might be in one right now
15675,"No, probably V10.1"
15676,"Merging code branches &amp; one more QA-level release this week. Hopefully, EAP wide release week after."
15677,"Looking good. Smart summon is almost great. Drive-in theater mode, caraoke &amp; Cuphead are awesome."
15678,For sure on first crewed missions for exactly that reason
15679,"Wanted to build an electric car company in college. Was going to do PhD at Stanford in electric energy storage (ultracaps), but got distracted for a few years by the Internet."
15680,years ago
15681,November most likely
15682,Were almost there
15683,Tesla doing laps at Nerdburgering
15684,But Taycan does seem like a good car. Nrburgring track time is great.
15685,Sounds sweaty
15686,A Neuralink could increase this by several orders of magnitude
15687,Uh no
15688,"Legs, but this render isnt accurate"
15689,"In some of those, Im even funny"
15690,Model S on Nrburgring next week
15691,"Also, cars are called automobiles"
15692,Jalopnik not sharpest tool in shed
15693,"Um , this word Turbo does not mean what you think it does"
15694,Looking into it
15695,"Yes, and it irony"
15696,"Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week."
15697,Its up to &amp; as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.
15698,"Same, except where limited by EU regulations. Were aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this &amp; are working with EU regulators to address."
15699,"In close traffic, poisonous gas spewing from the car in front of you goes straight into your AC intake. Good thing gas/diesel carmakers didnt cheat on their emissions or wed be in real trouble"
15700,Nice
15701,Gasoline is designed to burn
15702,Anywhere insurance prices are high
15703,"Yeah, several. Smart Summon most significant."
15704,Both and buttons in V10.0
15705,Yup
15706,Yes
15707,Definitely
15708,"Try Tesla Insurance. Should be ~20% less than avg. Currently only in California, but expanding soon. Critical feedback much appreciated."
15709,Opening on /9
15710,Slowpoke! Didnt even finish his hypothesis
15711,Haha actually true
15712,So good!
15713,Exactly
15714,Coming soon. Version at latest.
15715,Yes
15716,Iceland for sure!
15717,"Very soon, sorry for the delay"
15718,"Aiming for km flight in Oct &amp; orbit attempt shortly thereafter. Starship update will be on Sept th, anniversary of SpaceX reaching orbit. Starship Mk will be fully assembled by that time."
15719,Probably to months. Were about to ship Raptor SN .
15720,Probably m for next gen system
15721,"Would love to, but import duties are extremely high, even for electric vehicles"
15722,Should be. Will fix.
15723,"Also, u can order online at in mins, have car delivered to ur doorstep &amp; return for full refund"
15724,Cant believe its been years since our first vertical landing!
15725,Core body diameter is m/30ft
15726,R2D2s Dad
15727,Empty article?
15728,One day Starship will land on the rusty sands of Mars
15729,Congrats SpaceX team!!
15730,About to do next Starhopper flight test
15731,Dragon Crew Arm. Astronauts will walk this gantry to enter Dragon &amp; depart for the .
15732,Dronship with wings folded traveling through Panama Canal
15733,Interesting
15734,Not that I know of
15735,"Yes, rather embarrassing tbh"
15736,Impressively accurate analysis!
15737,Hopefully next year
15738,Appears to be a wiring/connector issue
15739,Igniters need to be inspected. We will try again tomorrow same time.
15740,"Raptor uses dual redundant torch igniters. Better long-term, but more finicky in development."
15741,About mins from flight attempt
15742,Starhopper flight currently tracking to pm Texas time for m / ~500ft hover test
15743,"Finally, VR thats cool *and* sexy!"
15744,Oh behave u naughty planet
15745,Its quite robust
15746,Where are additional Superchargers most needed?
15747,Worlds first very large scale battery has worked out well
15748,"Yes, last flight for Hopper. If all goes well, it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor."
15749,Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
15750,"Agreed, thats the right future"
15751,Looks like Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
15752,Were working closely with EU regulators &amp; hope to clarify the timeline soon
15753,Ok
15754,Should be soon
15755,"If youre a utility or public utilities commission, please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment &amp; usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants!"
15756,"Yes, probably within next to months"
15757,Tesla is working hard to help stop global warming
15758,The Nude Scientist
15759,Looks like a wheel of cheese
15760,Ok
15761,"We need to complete internal QA testing for safety, which will hopefully be done in about weeks"
15762,Wow
15763,Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
15764,"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version with smart summon is in wide release, which is about to weeks away, depending on how early access goes"
15765,"Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar systems fusion reactor (the sun)."
15766,"True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky."
15767,"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
15768,"Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk has Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
15769,Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
15770,"Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is % that of Earth &amp; gravity is %, but doable for localized warming"
15771,Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
15772,"AF certification required an enormous amount of work. Its mostly design-review based, not flight-based."
15773,"Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters"
15774,"Initially Model , later Y"
15775,Looking forward to seeing Giga Shanghai soon Amazing work by Tesla China team &amp; support of authorities much appreciated!
15776,Not yet
15777,This is a great idea
15778,Um I ate most of it
15779,Cookie decorating contest with kids
15780,Converts about million tons of mass to energy every second
15781,"Great name! Wouldnt worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit Earth eventually &amp; we currently have no defense."
15782,"Dont know yet, but its important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so well make costs as low as possible"
15783,One click to order solar &amp; save ~$500/year in utility bills with no long-term contract (cancel anytime)
15784,Next year
15785,"With the new lower Tesla pricing, its like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious."
15786,Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think
15787,Which means a small corner of Texas (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire United States
15788,Gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches Earths surface
15789,In a few years
15790,"Yeah, legs are hydraulic pistons &amp; abdomen is the accumulator"
15791,Generates a *lot* of energy
15792,It is quite silly
15793,Meaning less than a century. But this would be pretty intense.
15794,"Aspirationally, decades"
15795,The sun is an immense thermonuclear explosion fyi
15796,Yes
15797,"Not saying it solves everything, mind you, but its a step in the right direction"
15798,"Yeah, the trick is opening &amp; closing the spacesuit helmet really fast"
15799,Stop hashtagging me
15800,Perhaps that one was too edgy
15801,Hashtags are an abomination
15802,"No, as better to vary thickness with vehicle height, but this is the right way to go for Boring Co tunnels reinforcement imo"
15803,Nuking Mars one T-shirt at a time
15804,Simulations all the way down
15805,"Trust me, it will be"
15806,"Hey babe, fancy a hot date ?"
15807,Its not boring
15808,Of course!
15809,T-shirt soon
15810,Guess I sort of am already
15811,Id play that game
15812,Nuke Mars!
15813,This isnt correct. Will address.
15814,Good conversation with head of FAA Space. Need a bit more hazard analysis &amp; should be clear to fly soon.
15815,Am talking to in a few hours
15816,"Stacking fairing &amp; tanks soon, then adding control fins, engines &amp; landing gear"
15817,That was my actual password at one point!
15818,Stop posting my password on twitter!
15819,Coming
15820,"Tesla audio engineers come from B&amp &amp; many other companies. They literally rq. Our system is highly programmable, so we keep improving it via OTA codec updates."
15821,Well take care of it
15822,Corporate Surrealism
15823,Not yet
15824,fyi
15825,heh heh
15826,True
15827,No but srsly dont do it
15828,Roughly
15829,Ok
15830,Possibly two weeks
15831,Try playing Powerglide in your Tesla at volume
15832,Working on upgrades to Sentry
15833,No plans to introduce air suspension on Model at this time
15834,"Watching a movie on Tesla V10.0 is great, in large part due to the sound system"
15835,Obviously needed
15836,He would our first openly goth president. I think this is very important.
15837,I support Yang
15838,When Opportunity knocks
15839,Passing fad. Like steam engines. They look cool in a museum.
15840,Because our universe is actually a microverse in a miniverse. We probably just power someones brake lights.
15841,"Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge"
15842,"Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes"
15843,"Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly . Even though Im immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build days/week, it still doesnt feel real."
15844,"Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B"
15845,"Powerwall doesnt need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels"
15846,Yes
15847,Between $100B and $10T
15848,Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
15849,For sure
15850,Yup
15851,Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
15852,Gas cars are so last-century!
15853,Priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with FSD
15854,"Were accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!"
15855,"Probably every to months, depending on how much progress we make"
15856,Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke!
15857,FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue
15858,Thanks for reminding me. Will rectify.
15859,Tons of fun!
15860,Tesla software V10 is lookin real good! Releasing to early access list soon
15861,Pot kettle
15862,"Dont know enough about Georges company, but it sounds like hes focused on a machine vision approach, which is the only general solution imo"
15863,"Yeah, George is a little nuts, but I like him &amp; he often has interesting things to say"
15864,No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
15865,"Wouldnt read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights."
15866,Thanks George!
15867,"Were working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesnt quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world."
15868,But actual road data is what matters most
15869,"Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is % safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident."
15870,"Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff"
15871,Well said!
15872,Ok
15873,Strangers in the Night
15874,Sure
15875,Rocket fairing falling from space (higher res)
15876,And really knows cars!
15877,Rocket fairing falls from space &amp; is caught by Ms Tree boat
15878,"Fairing caught, video posting soon"
15879,Hoping to catch the fairing in a few mins
15880,"Race to orbit by both teams, although a success by both in close proximity would be amazing &amp; each would count as a win"
15881,Details coming at Starship update
15882,"Not in current plans, but that may change"
15883,No
15884,"Vandenberg is great for polar orbits. Will still play an important role long-term, but %+ will be eastward."
15885,"Great progress by Starship Cape team. Started several months behind, but catching up fast. This will be a super fun race to orbit, moon &amp; Mars!"
15886,"So much drama &amp; good times too! Maybe worth a book one day, but would come at expense of &amp; &amp; ."
15887,Headed to Starship Cape Canaveral build site today
15888,Just left Starship Texas build site. Very proud of progress SpaceX team has made! Pics are of m dome rotation &amp; Starship airframe behind windbreak.
15889,Lyft/Uber/taxi drivers are expert Tesla advocates. Thanks for your support!!
15890,Yes
15891,Progress is accelerating
15892,Queen
15893,Teletub
15894,Workin on it. One of my boys maybe gonna make this here candy.
15895,am guity
15896,Its all about branding
15897,The best guide by far!
15898,Will Dojo to be the difference
15899,That is a great guide
15900,philosophically
15901,"His name is Eric, of course"
15902,Its about time I suppose
15903,Mad skillz
15904,Yes
15905,A US
15906,Fred Astaire &amp; Ginger Rogers
15907,True
15908,I Top Hat
15909,It finally almost doesnt suck
15910,all u can
15911,"Oh my, what a dashingly handsome hat you have!"
15912,The lost art of entomological haberdashery &amp; millinery
15913,I dare say that could use a nice
15914,"Yes, detailed review of the first orbital Starship, explaining the pros &amp; cons of each design decision"
15915,We are tiny
15916,"Very convincing! Ok, Boca it is. We should have Starship Mk1 with Raptors almost ready to fly by then."
15917,I wouldve been bankrupt too. Unlikely investors would have funded a second attempt.
15918,Relief
15919,"Ok, will discuss with team"
15920,Sure
15921,"Also, you can request any service from the Tesla phone app in under a minute"
15922,"August th, either at Cape Canaveral or Boca Chica"
15923,"That was our last chance to reach orbit. If it had failed, SpaceX would have died."
15924,Yes
15925,Will also be launching The Boring Company China on this trip
15926,Good idea
15927,Youre most welcome!
15928,Fates loves irony
15929,"For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes."
15930,Not sure. Will check with my team.
15931,"Im told import duties are extremely high (up to %), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable."
15932,"Orbital refilling is vital to humanitys future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first."
15933,Fixing
15934,Depot haha
15935,Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
15936,Never thought wed make it this far
15937,Ancient times
15938,Spooling up production line rapidly. Hoping to manufacture ~1000 solar roofs/week by end of this year.
15939,Tesla Megapack now available for utility-scale energy storage
15940,"Thanks Jason! Super proud to work with such great teams at SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and Boring!!"
15941,Falcon rocket reentry from space with double sonic booms
15942,"Now that Hopper has flown, Starship update probably in two weeks or so."
15943,Falcon piercing the sound barrier on reentry
15944,Thanks for letting me know
15945,You can
15946,Vehicle alert seen show up automatically &amp; enable single touch request for service for that item either from the car screen or mobile app
15947,System automatically selects between mobile service &amp; service center appointment. Say prefer mobile in comments to bias. We will add a check box for mobile preferred.
15948,Tesla owners can schedule service appointments in under a minute just using their Tesla phone app!
15949,"Were working on it. Agreed, Minecraft is high priority. Roblox too."
15950,Sure
15951,Haha probably true (sigh)
15952,"Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August"
15953,Tesla Service Centers &amp; a lot more Superchargers coming to Poland later this year
15954,Will recognize &amp; read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights &amp; stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
15955,"Hoping to get Joe Mode into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting Joe Mode would lower the volume of strident beeps &amp; chimes by half."
15956,"If not immediately, will be followed shortly in a point release"
15957,Yes
15958,Some
15959,"Not currently in V10, but will try"
15960,"Yes, V10 will include several games &amp; infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light &amp; stop sign recognition &amp; Smart Summon"
15961,Cant you just play though phone Bluetooth?
15962,"Were close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe to months."
15963,"Maybe August, not more than a few months"
15964,"Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound"
15965,"When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving"
15966,"Ability to stream YouTube &amp; Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats &amp; surround sound audio."
15967,"Yes, really enjoyed it, although wish shed made it up to sky city"
15968,"Unity port is done, so finessing the controls now. Mostly limited by local storage. Will allow additional game storage via USB. Whatevers most fun!"
15969,And those who werent expecting a ternary joke
15970,Will run v high res at fps. Cuphead doesnt need k.
15971,Cuphead for Tesla coming out in August
15972,Space fairies are real
15973,Frank Frazetta
15974,Encounter in
15975,Drone cam
15976,Thanks!
15977,Engine cam
15978,Yes
15979,m hop in a week or two
15980,Starhopper flight successful. Water towers *can* fly haha!!
15981,"Btw, you can schedule service via the Tesla app in less than a minute"
15982,Good point. Getting fixed
15983,Probably /4 to /2 of that capacity would be for stationary storage
15984,Launch underway
15985,"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"
15986,Pc (chamber pressure) high due to colder than expected propellant
15987,Thin tiles on windward side of ship &amp; nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
15988,"Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe."
15989,Wearing black not recommended
15990,"High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you arent hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective."
15991,One Space Station image for each visit
15992,Me too
15993,"In a million years, the Universe will go from being to billion years old. Like tears in the rain"
15994,Exciting modes!
15995,True
15996,Time to face reality
15997,Were all just made of two quarks &amp; a lepton
15998,Center engines gimbal to degrees
15999,"For engine config, are mounted outboard under landing leg fairings"
16000,"Outer engines stick out slightly from m diameter, dont gimbal &amp; are mechanically joined at nozzle"
16001,tough
16002,"To be clear: good for in-space transit, but not recommended for Earth to orbit!"
16003,Very unlikely
16004,Goodbye
16005,Nuclear thermal rocket for fast transit around solar system would be a great area of research for
16006,Do EV owners use V to G a lot in Australia?
16007,"Probably have slots for up to engines, but can decontent as needed. Starship update after Hopper hover."
16008,I am become meme
16009,Dance Dance
16010,Next years competition will be in a km vacuum tunnel with a curve
16011,Woohoo
16012,"Orbital refilling is critical for high payload to moon or Mars. Initially just Starship to Starship, later dedicated tankers."
16013,means cute water
16014,Odd
16015,New top speed of km/h!!
16016,Just saw that on a T-shirt competition
16017,"Technically, alcohol is a solution"
16018,"Full stack is rn, but kinda beggin for just one more"
16019,Way too long
16020,Starship Super Heavy with Raptors
16021,I have the t-shirt
16022,Wont change. Starship launch structure will be attached to the other side from tower.
16023,Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
16024,to months after that
16025,It *is* vision
16026,I suspect many besides SpaceX will livestream these flights. Wont be subtle.
16027,Texas and Florida Starship prototypes (not Hopper) fly in to months
16028,Made with rain
16029,Coming soon
16030,Yes
16031,Tesla Service Centers &amp; Superchargers are being opened as fast as possible across Eastern Europe
16032,"This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket &amp; space station technology. Great respect."
16033,"No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot"
16034,"Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as youd expect."
16035,Maybe end of next year
16036,Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
16037,"Post test fuel leak, but no major damage"
16038,Aiming for hover test next week
16039,"Yeah, big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!"
16040,"This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features"
16041,Good piece
16042,I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer. Our new Raven powertain &amp; adaptive damping suspension is great! Next is Model P &amp; then X if driving with my kids. Acceleration is fun on tap!
16043,"Exactly. There is no MSRP, only P."
16044,With anything online
16045,Rococo Basilisk
16046,"yes, security is extremely important"
16047,Sure
16048,"Thoughtful analysis. We will endeavor to provide the robots, chips &amp; software to academia."
16049,Neuralink surprise twist!
16050,Is there a longer edit I can post?
16051,I think so
16052,"Something like this is the best way to do it. Incent outcome, not path."
16053,About to go live
16054,Not easy getting a lightsaber into backpack
16055,Approximately km/s
16056,SpaceX has Area
16057,"Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP"
16058,"If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more. Gen Shinseki"
16059,"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit."
16060,Probably
16061,Agreed. Thats approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
16062,Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August
16063,"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a . FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you cant make enough of them &amp; we wont be able to."
16064,"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
16065,"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"
16066,Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.
16067,Presentation streaming live from at pm Pacific
16068,Streaming. Check Neuralink website later today. Starts around pm.
16069,"Wont be today, hopefully tomorrow"
16070,"Sure, will do"
16071,"This guy is not a cofounder of Neuralink. Was at company briefly, but he didnt work out."
16072,"We are tiny, simple creatures"
16073,RIP
16074,Um yes
16075,Grahams number
16076,To Infinity and Beyond!
16077,SpaceX thruster package will be subtle. Hidden behind license plate.
16078,Haha yes
16079,"Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers."
16080,"Yeah, thats next after summon"
16081,"Will trace back inertial measurements &amp; wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off"
16082,"Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year"
16083,Probably mph or km/h
16084,Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
16085,Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
16086,"Agreed, its a small, but important, feature"
16087,Ok
16088,"Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs"
16089,Take note
16090,"About right, but dangerously chuggy &amp; risking bad things at %. Well keep it above % for this flight."
16091,"More like to mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is *v*sin /2, as I recall, but doesnt matter, as theres no geo anywhere near that mass."
16092,"mT to mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never."
16093,Cont of main
16094,We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
16095,~20m up &amp; sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully km up in a few months.
16096,Sure
16097,Raptor engine mounted on Starhopper. Aiming for hover test Tues.
16098,Great team
16099,Motor Trend awards Tesla Model S best Car of the Year ever in their year history!!
16100,"Its Not a Flamethrower, Mr Escobar"
16101,Sure
16102,Exactly
16103,The is moving at ~25 times the speed of sound &amp; orbits the Earth every minutes
16104,Ok
16105,"Absolutely agree, you should be allowed to move your Tesla anywhere in the world, unless its prevented by government rules. Thanks for letting me know."
16106,Feeling extra button
16107,Done. Im feeling &amp; Im feeling navigation buttons coming with next software release.
16108,Whoop Whoop!!
16109,I think so. Will check.
16110,Would be cool if car took you to a random fun place traveled to by other Tesla owners in the area
16111,Sigh
16112,The answer is always aliens
16113,Nice
16114,I have over the years
16115,That was a real sign
16116,"I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably, some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for years."
16117,True
16118,Exactly
16119,No
16120,No
16121,"There is no refreshed Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production months ago."
16122,This shampoo sounds amazing
16123,No problem
16124,The Cape is one of the two Starship build sites. More on this later.
16125,!freespace
16126,May the light of consciousness shine bright
16127,"Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising."
16128,Exactly
16129,Sure
16130,"To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car"
16131,"Between first development engine &amp; first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware &amp; software. Over time, thousands."
16132,Upgrading to kW soon
16133,"Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to % safety."
16134,Local supporters will be invited!
16135,Yes
16136,~Q4
16137,"End of Q4, most likely"
16138,"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality wont diverge until Q4, as its limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
16139,This is why its possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars
16140,All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer
16141,Starship Mk &amp; Hopper
16142,Wrlq
16143,Agreed
16144,Later in life Bakunin is underappreciated
16145,Listening to Revolutions by Duncan Found this on a throw pillow
16146,"Will do Starship presentation a few weeks after Hopper hovers, so prob late July. If that timing works, free LJ chips for all present!"
16147,My D&amp char was NG
16148,Sounds like fun
16149,Occupy Mars
16150,Cat is out of the bag
16151,"Exciting progress in Boca! Hopper almost ready to hover. Based on tonights test, looks like Hz Raptor vibration problem is fixed."
16152,Sharknado is real
16153,When sheets come loose all dignity is lost
16154,Model X as it should be shown
16155,What ants must feel like
16156,Yeah
16157,Landing on Ms. Tree
16158,Rocket fairing returning from space
16159,"Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident &amp; do our best to minimize probability of recurrence."
16160,"We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth &amp; becoming multiplanetary via Mars. Its not clear how much time we have to do these things, but sooner is definitely better."
16161,Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians &amp; cyclists especially.
16162,Should be fixed soon
16163,Reason for top rating is that active steering &amp; braking safety features of Tesla Autopilot are turned on no cost for all cars
16164,Congratulations Tesla team &amp; thanks to all the new Tesla owners!!
16165,Sure
16166,Good one
16167,Meme of recursive irony
16168,Not often these days. Good way to spend time with kids though.
16169,Playing a little Polytopia. Gonna try Solaris w my boys.
16170,Death Note
16171,"Yeah, exactly"
16172,"Yep, order online at in mins &amp; car delivered direct to home"
16173,Is this true ?
16174,"FWIW, based on calcs I did years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over Wh/kg today, but probably exceed in ~5 years."
16175,"Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines"
16176,"Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves."
16177,Huge thanks to all Tesla supporters around the world helping the cause. We you!!
16178,Tweak music &amp; car karaoke
16179,"Fun, little music tool coming later"
16180,Sure. Want to add easy import/export of images from your phone.
16181,Thanks for the happy birthday wishes!
16182,"One day, there will be a little racing game in the racing game in the car"
16183,Merkindise coming soon!
16184,They have the best merkins
16185,Im such a bad public speaker! Damn.
16186,These do seem like wise words
16187,If only wed listened
16188,"But, if youre going to buy a merkin, be sure to haggle properly!"
16189,"If you dont already know what a merkin is, dont google it. You have been warned."
16190,Typing Merlin literally just autocorrected me to merkin
16191,"We poured our heart &amp; soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Faberg egg of cars."
16192,"Hardly anyone noticed, but still"
16193,We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
16194,Design &amp; production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible
16195,sec -60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
16196,Thats actually kinda true
16197,Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesnt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
16198,Youre touching on a good critique of Falcon . Our st stage to nd stage propellant ratio is too high. Were fixing that with Starship.
16199,"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disneys Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but youd exit on another continent."
16200,"~1000, as all seats would be coach &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be to mins. Its basically an ICBM traveling at Mach that lands."
16201,"About , assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
16202,"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low"
16203,There will be no Block . Moving to Starship architecture.
16204,"Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
16205,"Good to see this. Splitting interstage into sections will have some challenges, but could work."
16206,Probably sooner
16207,Ok
16208,"Sure, that would be an honor"
16209,Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
16210,High entry force &amp; heat breached engine bay &amp; center engine TVC failed
16211,"Ok, thanks"
16212,Working on Tesla global logistics
16213,I know sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
16214,"Yes, but we couldnt take a chance on nd stage failing its th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything Im aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well."
16215,Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
16216,High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
16217,Center core RUD. It was a long shot.
16218,He was the real deal
16219,One of our main conference rooms at SpaceX is named after Goddard
16220,"No, its along the way"
16221,Colonizing Mars one mug at a time!
16222,Waiting for Falcon Heavy to launch means high cortisol levels. This is our toughest rocket launch ever.
16223,Yeah
16224,Heat will breathe life into Mars
16225,Yes! I love botanical gardens. This is my favorite:
16226,Absolutely
16227,"Yeah, that sounds ideal! I love the KSC rocket garden. Spent many days there looking at rocket design details."
16228,Uh oh
16229,Ok
16230,"On Mars, I like to drink my coffee in this mug"
16231,Chomsky is the Iago of socio-economic theory &amp; Piketty is his docile puppet
16232,Starship will do orbital launches from Boca Chica (near Brownsville) &amp; Cape
16233,"At Cape for launch, so watched on hotel screen, but still so beautiful"
16234,Just watched it from your link
16235,Yeah
16236,Apollo
16237,"Yes, the droids can now hold down the center core"
16238,"Odds of center core surviving are about % imo, as its coming in about times faster than a rifle bullet"
16239,Tesla Software Engineering
16240,Falcon Heavy on LC-39A
16241,"All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms"
16242,Its a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
16243,"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
16244,"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about bar more"
16245,Merlin could probably do flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
16246,So cool
16247,Anything with high contrast
16248,Excessive shades of grey
16249,"Yeah, weve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous."
16250,"Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps."
16251,Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
16252,Haha
16253,Depends on destination
16254,"Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to mT level"
16255,"Since Raptor produces tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."
16256,Chomsky sucks
16257,"Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite"
16258,Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
16259,"More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven"
16260,"Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so /year. Still, non-trivial at tons of thrust/year."
16261,"Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every hours by end of year."
16262,"For sure moon st, as its only days away &amp; u dont need interplanetary orbital synchronization"
16263,Moon too
16264,Earth
16265,After Starship returns from orbit
16266,Mars belongs to the Martians
16267,A lot.

16273,Haha
16274,"A few other small things change, but pretty close"
16275,Tesla is putting significant resources into high-efficiency battery recycling. Makes both environmental &amp; economic sense. Please consider joining if interested in recycling engineering!
16276,"No, were already recycling them"
16277,"Yes, demographics, stratified by age, will look like an upside down pyramid with many old people &amp; fewer young"
16278,"Real issue will an aging &amp; declining world population by , *not* overpopulation. Randers estimate far more accurate than UN imo:"

16280,Yezz
16281,Stonk tip of the day
16282,Kids playing Beach Buggy in Tesla store
16283,"Exactly. And many areas of countries showing good Internet actually have poor or no access, so those are important to address too."
16284,One of my favorite original Roadster colors!
16285,How about baby pink?
16286,Reminder that US federal tax drops by $1875 for any Tesla delivered after June . Order online at .
16287,"Changing the palette is hell on service, because cars last for years. Every color change has a long tail of hurt, especially for Model ."
16288,A simple white (not pearl multi-coat)
16289,"Starting next month, Tesla will charge $1000 for color black (same price as silver)"
16290,Will consider
16291,This will be our most difficult launch ever
16292,But on the inside
16293,Original Star Wars
16294,Sole meunire
16295,Probably fine. Some Tesla taxis in Amsterdam have times that mileage.

16297,"Non, je ne regrette meme"
16298,Missed you too
16299,Touched by an
16300,Not sure yet
16301,My chariot license is made of papyrus!
16302,Thats the Tesla part
16303,Overall master plan should be explained. I think it still makes sense if we dont consider AI b other.
16304,Ive been tweeting strange shit since Ramses II. He was a great pharaoh!
16305,Might get pushed to next month. Starhopper flight first. Waiting on engine repair.
16306,"years ago, SpaceX server room was named Skynet as a joke. Fate irony."
16307,Thanks
16308,Model arriving in UK
16309,Good question. Will consider thoughtful response.
16310,By far
16311,"Good analysis. Both computers will be used &amp; sync ~20 times per second. This is a long time to a computer. Like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one."
16312,Falcon Rising
16313,BG2 was so good
16314,"No need, Top Gear already did"
16315,The Ass Blade of Vengeance!
16316,Weird that this actually happened. Music makes a big difference.
16317,"Unlike bees, who are experts in millinery"
16318,"Truth is a metaphorical concept with no footwear or clothing of anything kind. Also, baby dont hurt me haha"
16319,"Yes, excessively configurable seats almost always make things worse, rather than better. Too complex &amp; unwieldy."
16320,"Cool, thats the way it should be!"
16321,Cant fool me it was
16322,Sounds about right
16323,Dont make me challenge you to a rap battle!!
16324,Fair point
16325,"Yeah, dual motor AWD is super fun!"
16326,RWD with all-weather tires works great. Tesla traction control is an order of magnitude more precise than gas/diesel. Really helps to have Newton &amp; Maxwell on your side.
16327,Thanks Bob! He is a tough critic.
16328,"Not only was the paint without any discernible flaw, but the various panels formed a body of precision that was beyond reproach"
16329,Also $2500 tax credit for California &amp; $500 to $800 utility incentive
16330,US tax credit of $3750 drops in half for Tesla on July . Order online in a few mins at . Return in days for full refund.
16331,Tesla Solar Toof Tile V3.0 starting early trials
16332,Exactly
16333,(muffled titter)
16334,Haha
16335,Would be good to look up electricity rates by location &amp; optimize cost automatically
16336,"Yeah, they were a little off the mark"
16337,Fun!
16338,"Applies to a small number of Bay Area residents, but worth checking out"
16339,is relativistic side effect of
16340,Strong incentive to make up &amp; promote negative news
16341,"True, cost of operating a Tesla is much lower than other cars"
16342,Landing in the fog
16343,Fear (and memes) get clicks
16344,"Storm Watch was active for hundreds of Powerwall customers this weekend as a result of Red Flag Fire Warnings in California, and we will continue to activate it whenever there advance awareness of a potential power outage or physical danger"
16345,Absolutely agree. Major expansion of service centers underway.
16346,Super fair criticism. Were putting max resources on this. Hard to hire enough repair technicians in Norway! Please apply if interested.
16347,Norway
16348,"Good point. Maybe we could collect rainwater, add a little antifreeze in cold climates &amp; make it last for years."
16349,Annual tire rotation is actually optional. Only worthwhile if you see significant differential wear on inside vs outside of tire.
16350,Yes
16351,Upcoming Falcon Heavy &amp; details
16352,China EV subsidies mostly end this month &amp; fully end in about months
16353,Yes
16354,No problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline. Its great to get thoughtful criticism.
16355,"mph is common on the Autobahn. Even with only offramp tunnels, exit speed drops to mph."
16356,Tesla Superchargers &amp; service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year
16357,"Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings"
16358,"Avg speed of NY Subway is actually mph. TBC loop can run at mph with pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. Thats /hour/lane &amp; you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput &amp; convenience."
16359,Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them.
16360,Exactly
16361,"Were trying to simplify product complexity, so only offering white (technically black &amp; white) interior in high volume markets"

16370,"Also HEPA filter is expensive, so would force increase in price"
16371,Same
16372,Not enough room unless we completely delete front trunk. Model S &amp; X primary HEPA filter alone is literally % bigger than normal car air filter.
16373,S/X HEPA filter is one of my favorite features
16374,Model Performance
16375,Feedback received. Restoring white interior.
16376,Thats the idea
16377,Thoughtful model
16378,"Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further"
16379,Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto &amp; oil companies arent known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors &amp; space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
16380,"Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach ."
16381,"Add to more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result."
16382,Wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). Doesnt affect schedule much though.
16383,Not bad
16384,Exactly. Were on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
16385,"Yeah, the fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights"
16386,I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
16387,"One days grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow."
16388,Edgy move
16389,Good idea
16390,True. Im a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
16391,Yup
16392,Would love to do exactly that
16393,"Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. Well get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun."
16394,"Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, well make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
16395,Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
16396,"Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy."
16397,"Aiming for sub ms latency initially, sub ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers"
16398,"If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, thats easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map."
16399,"There are already satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink wont be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible."
16400,"No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."
16401,Fair
16402,Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
16403,Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
16404,"Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
16405,"Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. Isp &amp; up to % thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."
16406,Whoa cool
16407,Yes
16408,Beautiful solar sail
16409,ISS is extremely gigantic &amp; has lights
16410,"Precisely, sats will be in darkness when stars are visible"
16411,Exactly
16412,Karma
16413,Bold move
16414,Stop sending me this tron - Audi
16415,Great ad
16416,This is complete nonsense
16417,Exactly. A car being electric &amp; upgradable to full self-driving maximizes future resale value.
16418,Its not my finest work
16419,"Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. Consumers are starting to realize this."
16420,"Krypton thrusters operative, satellites initiating orbit raise every mins"
16421,No
16422,Absolutely
16423,"Yes, to months"
16424,Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
16425,Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
16426,Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
16427,"Opposite is true: you can have s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below"
16428,"Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesnt matter"
16429,"Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!"
16430,Paperwork &amp; hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
16431,"LA has a subway, but most people dont know about it"
16432,That would great!
16433,Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. Its optional!
16434,Boring Company guide to why tunnels are awesome &amp; safest place to be in an earthquake
16435,"So far, so good"
16436,"Ironically, same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value and imply Tesla is worthless. They cant *both* be true!"
16437,Gary the still crushes us! Wouldnt be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
16438,Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
16439,This is simple and just works
16440,Pretty much
16441,Racing at mph in a tunnel under LA
16442,Fairing halves recovered
16443,Krypton ion thrusters activate in about hours to raise orbit
16444,"All Starlink satellites online, solar array deployment coming up soon"
16445,"Thanks! Yeah, thats pretty close."
16446,Launch in mins
16447,"New S &amp; X are much improved. Worth trying out. Youre on version , current S/X is version ."
16448,Its smart *and* enhanced!
16449,Smart Summon coming soon!
16450,"Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX, looking at rocket"
16451,"Part of the factory is being upgraded, but tours will continue around the parts that arent"
16452,"Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full."
16453,Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
16454,~2.8m
16455,"Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber."
16456,Horizontally
16457,"First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around ."
16458,So it goes
16459,months
16460,"Hopefully, months"
16461,Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
16462,"Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees"
16463,Sure
16464,Two tunnels about a mile long each
16465,Yes
16466,"Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, youd have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!"
16467,"Aiming for tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least tons, allowing for mass growth"
16468,N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
16469,"Hoping for sec Isp, but at least . Otherwise similar to sea level version."
16470,Aspirationally
16471,"sea level optimized Raptors, vacuum optimized Raptors (big nozzle)"
16472,"After the GoT finale, we dropped it to"
16473,"Mk1 &amp; Mk2 ships at Boca &amp; Cape will fly with at least engines, maybe all"
16474,"About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every days this summer"
16475,Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in months. Aiming to finish by end of year.
16476,"The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer &amp; impellers."
16477,"But, essentially, the spinning things"
16478,Yes
16479,"Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower."
16480,Did it for the memes
16481,Coming soon
16482,"Yeah, been thinking about it for a long time. Electric supersonic VTOL. Hard problem."
16483,Hopefully in about days
16484,Physics favors full flow
16485,Good design imo
16486,Thanks Sam!
16487,Good piece on lower total cost of ownership of electric vehicles
16488,Sorry to hear that. Will fix.
16489,Ok
16490,Easy to turn one of our Starlink satellites into a debris collector
16491,Yes
16492,Almost ready. Im testing it personally this weekend.
16493,Yes
16494,Also porting Unreal Engine
16495,Nintendo wont let us
16496,"Maybe so eventually, but it will be information &amp; entertainment, not trickery"
16497,"Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead, we use that money to make the product great."
16498,We def need racing game using actual car steering wheel &amp; pedals!
16499,Sure
16500,Of course
16501,Portal &amp; on this would rock
16502,Would be great to have &amp; !
16503,"Interact with games via touchscreen, steering wheel buttons &amp; XBox/PS controllers"
16504,Lots more games coming once we finish porting Unity!
16505,Top Secret
16506,"It technically could, but wouldnt have enough mass margin for a heat shield, landing propellant or legs, so not reusable"
16507,"No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives &amp; forks are made of."
16508,"Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels"
16509,Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways.
16510,This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S &amp; X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters.
16511,"Yeah, feels like something is messed up with Apple news app. Almost only ever shows negative news. Nickname is the hate stream"
16512,Congrats on many successful launches!
16513,And I am forever grateful
16514,Set of all math jokes that are actually funny is pretty small (sigh)
16515,"Physics demands the impedance of resistance, because its not real"
16516,What makes resistance complex is that its half imaginary!
16517,Glad it worked out
16518,Congratulations &amp; on creating great open source literacy software!
16519,"more launches of for initial activation, for significant coverage"
16520,"Starlink mission will be heaviest payload ever at tons. If all goes well, each launch of satellites will generate more power than Space Station &amp; deliver terabit of bandwidth to Earth."
16521,Thats about right
16522,Probably start installing end of next month
16523,"SN4 is done. Hawthorne is working on SN5 now, but focus is ramping build rate of SN6 through SN10."
16524,"The opposite. Any insights gained by one team must be shared with the other, but other team not required to use them."
16525,Both sites will make many Starships. This is a competition to see which location is most effective. Answer might be both.
16526,SpaceX is doing simultaneous competing builds of Starship in Boca Chica Texas &amp; Cape Canaveral Florida
16527,"A lot, but you cant count on lines"
16528,Exactly
16529,Its a factor
16530,GoT season finale leaked
16531,"Technically, his bro"
16532,Happy Mothers Day. I love you Mom!
16533,Ok
16534,Completely agree. Every Tesla should have good art &amp; music creation software.
16535,It is flat-packed. No dispenser.
16536,That *might* not be my lucky number
16537,"More details on day of launch, currently tracking to Wednesday"
16538,"Much will likely go wrong on st mission. Also, more launches of sats needed for minor coverage, for moderate."
16539,"These are production design, unlike our earlier Tintin demo sats"
16540,"If static fire on Mon, on Tues"
16541,First Starlink satellites loaded into Falcon fairing. Tight fit.
16542,Ok
16543,u3k
16544,Exactly
16545,Yes
16546,"Yes, they are!"
16547,Will try it
16548,We have dogs &amp; cat. Dogs jump in car no problem. Cat does not. Experiment concluded.
16549,"Cats, probably not tbh"
16550,Truth
16551,"How about Future is driving you, followed by the word future several times in decreasing font size?"
16552,By Spiderwee on Artstation
16553,How about being able to look through any of the cameras?
16554,Sure
16555,Thats how I feel when I see dabbing
16556,. drives a Tesla across the loneliest road in America
16557,Probably June
16558,"Oh stop teasing, Jeff"
16559,But putting the word Blue on a ball is questionable branding
16560,Competition is good. Results in a better outcome for all.
16561,"We could have gamed an LA/NY Autopilot journey last year, but when we do it this year, everyone with Tesla Full Self-Driving will be able to do it too"
16562,That journey will have a diff age rating
16563,Latest Model S is slightly faster
16564,Basically begging for it
16565,Shoulda seen it coming
16566,Turns out theres more ways to use Autopilot than we imagined
16567,Soon
16568,Baby Thanos?
16569,Time
16570,Yes
16571,"Yeah, takes you to a big purple guy with a bejeweled gold glove"
16572,I was just there about a month ago
16573,Probably shouldnt have called holding company Cyberdyne Systems
16574,"Just behind the glovebox, which is, presumably, where the gloves are"
16575,"Hes just kidding, folks, but best to turn car off just in case. Also was years ago."
16576,Mein Herz brennt isboss fight song
16577,"Schatz, bitte hr auf- ich werde rot!"
16578,"Even though lease cost is lower, I recommend purchase, as buyer retains upside value of car vs lease where you have give it back to Tesla"
16579,"Model Standard Range+ with Autopilot lease is $399/month at , but lots of other EVs available:"
16580,Were closing the loop on Autobahn driving. Will improve dramatically in coming months. Ultra gemtlich.
16581,Oh. They have nice pictures there.
16582,There are people not on Twitter!? Where are they?
16583,Does look like fun
16584,Finnish Metal Rocks
16585,One of the biggest reusability improvements was fast leg stow. Version sometimes took days.
16586,"In recent years, hours were much higher. Dont recommend though bad for health &amp; happiness. But no choice or Tesla would die. Hope to reduce to hours next year."
16587,Been wanting to go ever since that Finnish metal band won

16596,"Wow, how did they take this video!?"
16597,Yes
16598,Looks about light-minutes away
16599,Relatively speaking
16600,"Space is easy, orbit is hard"
16601,"SpaceX needs to demonstrate more progress with Starship, but that will hopefully happen rapidly"
16602,". support for reusability with high reliability, the critical breakthrough for orbital rockets, has made a big difference"
16603,Will consider
16604,To air is human
16605,"Sorry for the inconvenience. Were aware of this glitch &amp; its fixed, but software updates wait for a WiFi connection. Policy has been changed to push updates like this over cell connection sooner."
16606,Close
16607,"Just kidding (obv), but the Fermi Paradox is bizarre"
16608,Maybe theyre among us. Just saying maybe
16609,Yeah definitely
16610,Triggered
16611,Candy is coming
16612,Thats a direct quote from Warren Buffett
16613,Also times more fun!
16614,Later this month. We need to merge a lot of updates into main code branch.
16615,"Order online in mins, day return policy"
16616,Margaritaville is one of my fav songs
16617,True
16618,Youre welcome. Thanks for buying a Tesla!
16619,Only if unable to order by May
16620,Here you go
16621,Ok
16622,Maybe this goat is available
16623,Changing Tesla horn sound to
16624,Sigh
16625,"Yeah, weird"
16626,Good question
16627,What should be developed on Ethereum?
16628,"Of M futures, M were simply death by boredom"
16629,Naturally Ramanujan
16630,How many futures are there actually?
16631,Stop giving away free ETH!
16632,And yet people ask what could possibly go wrong with AI
16633,Fate loves irony
16634,jk
16635,Ethereum
16636,Excellent analysis
16637,Deepfake
16638,OG wisdom
16639,Malcolm new book is
16640,Starships on Mars
16641,Yes
16642,Damn haters
16643,Starship on the moon
16644,Our competitors do
16645,We dont buy advertising
16646,Wheres the proof!?
16647,Genau
16648,Might be boring
16649,Physics is a set of compression functions for the simulation
16650,Its pretty much the only theory. This will mess with your mind:
16651,Sensors are for the weak. Just go open loop.
16652,So true
16653,As sure as night follows day
16654,Schrdinger is a probability distribution in the shape of a cat
16655,Any observation of Schrdinger changes Schrdinger
16656,"Once had a Great Dane named Hamlet, because Hamlet was a great Dane"
16657,The only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid!
16658,Thats them! Schrdinger is neither here nor there.
16659,Not as far as I know
16660,"We have a big dog called Gatsby, a little dog called Marvin the Martian &amp; a cat named Schrdinger"
16661,Yes
16662,"Quantum mechanics was harder than all my other courses combined, but so incredible"
16663,"NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs."
16664,I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
16665,"TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you cant transfer data fast enough between computer &amp; GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant."
16666,"Exactly, Tesla &amp; Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net"
16667,Were working on it. Takes time to get all regulatory approvals. Almost there for the larger US states. At least to months for Europe/UK.
16668,Certain regulatory agencies would beg to differ
16669,Haha yes
16670,"Its just me writing, so the foolish things I say are entirely my fault"
16671,"Only see about % of mentions. No deep logic to those I answer. Aspirationally useful, but often whimsical."
16672,"No, just preparing for untethered hover tests"
16673,"Tom is still an advisor to SpaceX, but semi-retired about years ago &amp; doesnt work on Raptor. Will Heltsley heads propulsion overall, but Raptor is a team effort. No single leader."
16674,Great work by Tesla China team &amp; supporting contractors!
16675,Hoping to cover all of Eastern Europe this year
16676,Yup
16677,Everyone knows
16678,Cramer is a simulation. Hes not real.
16679,Thats odd. Will look into it.
16680,UK order page will go live around May or
16681,We will delay $1k full self-driving option price increase until May for those unable to order by May
16682,"UK Model order page goes live next week, followed shortly thereafter by Japan, Australia, New Zealand &amp; Hong Kong"
16683,CleanTechnica summarizes new print cover story
16684,Haha
16685,"Will be sentient, of course"
16686,Range will be above km
16687,"Agreed, were ramping up service centers &amp; Tesla mobile service worldwide"
16688,"More like $1000, but varies by country due to big differences in tax"
16689,Considering
16690,"As mentioned before, Tesla full self-driving option price will increase after May . You can order online at ."
16691,Like blowing twigs too?
16692,Nope
16693,Motor Trend on Model S updates
16694,Model S drives from San Francisco to Los Angeles without recharging
16695,Strange but true
16696,This require hardware
16697,Can order online in mins for home delivery &amp; return in days for full refund
16698,New Model S has mile / km range
16699,Perhaps the Internet has some helpful suggestions?
16700,Cant think of anything
16701,Someone else thought of an electric blower first? What!?
16702,Tesla blows haha
16703,We can probably just repurpose Model HVAC parts. Not a big deal.
16704,True
16705,Long lasting battery + fast recharge &gt; pack swap
16706,Haha ok
16707,"Its been suggested by many, externally &amp; internally"
16708,Arent there good ones already?
16709,Maybe add a particulate filter on inlet
16710,"Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower"
16711,"Yeah, there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed, Fred. Hello."
16712,Will do
16713,Absolutely
16714,Seriously
16715,"Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez"
16716,"Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EVs have high fire risk when opposite is true."
16717,"Thanks, support super appreciated"
16718,Sad if true
16719,"When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe theres a good reason that isnt obvious."
16720,"Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over % *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?"
16721,"Over a million combustion engine (its right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
16722,"Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for -12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers + years late. Why the double standard?"
16723,Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between years &amp; never
16724,Anti-matter def wins on energy density
16725,"Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year."
16726,"As a robotaxi, probably closer to hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed."
16727,Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone
16728,Anyone who did this analysis should interview at Tesla
16729,Upgrading hardware is not important for a few months
16730,Is that a real billboard?
16731,Well let the NN loose on Track Mode one day thatll be insane
16732,Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark
16733,Or maybe pegging
16734,"On yeah, that too"
16735,"Exactly. Also, you cant actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds."
16736,Full Self-Driving video
16737,All Model s ever made can upgrade
16738,"Warning, this presentation is hrs &amp; mins long"
16739,Exactly
16740,All cars made since Oct either have the hardware needed for FSD or are trivially upgradeable
16741,"Yeah, will post soon"
16742,Its automatic
16743,Tesla Full Self-Driving
16744,Happy Home Planet Day!
16745,Full Metal Alchemy
16746,Love that movie!
16747,Actual Tesla range is about miles / km past zero
16748,Coming soon
16749,Already have one
16750,Respawn++
16751,The Internet is insane
16752,"Never seen anything like it. Tesla is just trying to make electric cars &amp; solar power for a better future for all. True, we might not succeed, but why do they want us to fail?"
16753,"Milady, my shield is yours"
16754,"This is extremely messed up. , whats going on?"
16755,FTW

16777,"propellant grade kerosene (basically, jet fuel) &amp; liquid oxygen are close, but H2 &amp; O2 are not"
16778,Common shaft only works if optimal rpm is similar for fuel &amp; oxidizer

16783,But Im just a simple sheep/ram
16784,Sheep replicants
16785,Sheeps thank you
16786,Are you good with sheep?
16787,Im an absolute unit too
16788,"Yeah, gave everything I had to Tesla in Dec"
16789,"Its not a big deal. Charge to % to % &amp; youll be fine. At % state of charge, regen braking doesnt work, because the battery is full, so car is less energy efficient."
16790,Haha
16791,Yes
16792,Rockets are not yet safe enough to fly over land
16793,"Engines seem ok, pending inspection"
16794,"It can, but the attachment fixtures are different from standard F9 &amp; they werent ready in time"
16795,Winter in snowfall is so beautiful
16796,Im actually less crazy in person or am I?
16797,I was always crazy on Twitter fyi
16798,Yes
16799,Haha true. I actually love horses.
16800,Buying a car in that cant upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in
16801,Love Just Water btw
16802,"With steel membrane wings like a Dragon, we may be able to lower Starships orbital reentry temp to ~1000 degrees C, which would allow the whole surface to be uncooled bare metal"
16803,Starship will land on a ring of fire
16804,Yes
16805,Winter is coming
16806,Thinking about adding giant stainless steel dragon wings to Starship
16807,"That tweet did take immense effort Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps."
16808,Deal
16809,Please support my campaign to rebrand as emoji!
16810,"At some point, and I should just a get a room"
16811,Just use this handy guide
16812,Yes
16813,Good interview by
16814,Truth
16815,Exactly
16816,How embarrassing. Will change.
16817,We will. You read it right.
16818,Haha true
16819,Ive always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
16820,"Good point, small oil is a problem too"
16821,"Im sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They cant *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expos pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps theyre all angels"
16822,"Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false."
16823,"True, Bloomberg is almost as bad"
16824,Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock puppets of big oil
16825,Starship is kinda Gundam
16826,"Very much so. There are B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing % of that fleet would require making M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over k cars in next months, but thats a mere % of M or % of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply."
16827,"Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesnt have access to the video unless sent to us by owner."
16828,Mint berry crunch
16829,poetic justice
16830,Boring candy coming soon
16831,"Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop."
16832,"Wow, a lot of people dont know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First -12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve."
16833,"There is GWh/yr theoretical capacity, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
16834,Yes
16835,"Yes, all cars with Autopilot or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date"
16836,"Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesnt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability"
16837,Yes
16838,"There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase"
16839,"Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later."
16840,Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
16841,Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla wont spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to GWh theoretical.
16842,Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
16843,Something like that
16844,Starting May
16845,Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time
16846,Coming this year
16847,Lease a Tesla online in a few mins &amp; have it delivered to your house (return within days for full refund)
16848,Cryptocurrency is my safe word
16849,Model drive unit &amp; body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last k to k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.
16850,Cool
16851,"On April , Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car"
16852,Uh its a simulation hello
16853,Da Vinci biography
16854,Malala
16855,That would be cool to do one day
16856,Other automakers change prices constantly &amp; substantially by varying rebates &amp; discounts according to negotiating strength of buyer. Tesla is transparent &amp; consistent.
16857,"So if we raise prices in the future, will you cut Tesla a check? Cant have it both ways."
16858,Ahem RHD
16859,LHD order page should be live within a few weeks. Deliveries start hopefully June/July.
16860,Coming this year
16861,Good point
16862,Leasing now available for Model
16863,Samwise
16864,Am basically doing continuous AMA on Twitter!
16865,"This is true. They each have avionics, several nitrogen thrusters &amp; steerable parachutes."
16866,SpaceX team
16867,Made on Earth by humans
16868,Yes
16869,"Recovered from water, but undamaged"
16870,Both fairing halves recovered. Will be flown on Starlink mission later this year.
16871,Thanks on behalf of team! We !
16872,Liquid oxygen
16873,The Falcons have landed
16874,. team would be so honored to fly this for !
16875,Haha exactly
16876,Upper atmospheric wind shear is very high. Will have to postpone launch unless weather improves soon.
16877,Vengeance
16878,Haha sure sounds like it
16879,Probably something notable to announce in a few months
16880,"I hope a cybernetic interface is ready in time. Symbiosis, irrelevance (hopefully blissful) or doom seem to be the three most likely paths."
16881,Actually true
16882,Found a pic
16883,"First flight for Falcon Heavy Block means there is some risk of failure between % to % imo. Many good design improvements from Falcon Heavy demo, but the changes are unproven."
16884,I first read this as making wind with
16885,Norway has already proven it could be done last month. No question Australia could do this in far fewer than years.
16886,. copy
16887,"No, its better"
16888,"Building primary structure completion seems on track for May, but then it will take several months to install &amp; activate factory equipment"
16889,Love Brunel. Great first name too.
16890,Yes
16891,Mobile can do it no problem
16892,"Doesnt matter yet whether you have Tesla FSD computer or Tesla Nvidia-based computer. When it does matter later this year, Tesla will switch the computers for you."
16893,What city?
16894,"Two, independent system-on-chip architecture, with each SoC having two NN accelerators that can perform simultaneous health-check calculations to protect against a soft error"
16895,Yes. Working through regulatory approvals.
16896,The Tesla Full Self-Driving Computer now in production is at about % compute load for these tasks or % with full fail-over redundancy
16897,Time flies
16898,Any user input counts
16899,Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability &gt;&gt; human.
16900,It will enable video when parked &amp; connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.
16901,Youre welcome. Thanks for your great photos!
16902,"Yeah, Id love to do that"
16903,Starhopper
16904,Good idea
16905,Definitely
16906,Already fixed
16907,To make core AP more affordable
16908,That would be cool. Color variation causes havoc though.
16909,"Team is working on international versions super hard btw. Unfortunately, regulators around the world have different rules &amp; processes, so just takes time."
16910,Tesla Enhanced Summon coming out in US next week for anyone with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option
16911,Precisely
16912,Almost done
16913,Are you on Mad Max Mode? This may be too meek for places like the LA Freeway
16914,Radar
16915,Sure
16916,Exactly
16917,"Base AP will have same NN, so core functionality also improves"
16918,Many different regulatory authorities. Just takes time.
16919,Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.
16920,Starhopper just lifted off &amp; hit tether limits!
16921,Max thrust of tons will be almost % higher than Falcon Heavy demo mission last year
16922,"Static fire data looks good so far. This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block , so were being extra cautious. Launch date might move."
16923,Exactly
16924,"drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for % of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance."
16925,Hi Nina! So how many would it take? Just between us.
16926,Stay positive
16927,Good point
16928,How much is it?
16929,"I think Ive paid for a subscription at least three times, but your paywall keeps forgetting this"
16930,"Please fix your paywall. Your content is great, but your paywall is not."
16931,Yes
16932,"Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars"
16933,Thats exactly the idea. Whats not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software &amp; going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April .
16934,Thanks
16935,Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed.
16936,Im told its looking positive &amp; we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas
16937,Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
16938,Impressive analysis
16939,"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, well add a setting to disable internal camera."
16940,"Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through nd side windows &amp; rear window."
16941,"Its there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."
16942,Will take care of it
16943,Improvements coming soon
16944,"Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input."
16945,Great name
16946,Neural net is upgraded too in this release. Its not just a settings change.
16947,"Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup."
16948,Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.
16949,Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car!
16950,This is way more awesome than it might sound
16951,Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower &amp; allow below current % level. Making that adjustment too.
16952,Agreed
16953,Night mode with % brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that % brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.
16954,Change your screen preference from night mode to auto
16955,Fur-curious
16956,These rumors are untrue!
16957,"Responsible for more deaths than any other chemical! Weirdly, dihydrogen dixoxide, with only one extra oxygen, is not good to drink, but great for changing hair color."
16958,Axel F
16959,"Obv just someone in a suit. Also, very sus that a is reporting on this."
16960,Dogecoin value may vary
16961,Dogecoin rulz
16962,Uh oh
16963,Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. Its pretty cool.
16964,Yup
16965,Some challenges with ice formation in the cryogenic propellant prevalves. Hopefully overcome soon.
16966,What could possibly go wrong?
16967,No
16968,Youre so right. Working on it!
16969,That car seemed so advanced when I watched that show as a kid! Knight Industries Two Thousand
16970,And even tinier ones for tardigrades
16971,Yes
16972,"Going forward, all Tesla stores will be tiny &amp; have tiny cars"
16973,"Meant to say young, but spelled it wrong"
16974,Ironic stan
16975,"If can do this, what cant they do!?"
16976,"Solid work by Keen, as usual"
16977,Norway
16978,Yes
16979,Yes
16980,Seems fair
16981,"Some people use their hair to express themselves, I use Twitter"
16982,Making The Onion articles real
16983,Duck emoji FTW
16984,Final edit was on Ableton
16985,"Surprisingly difficult to address false positives with rain. System would go nuts trying to wipe away non-existent rain, which was obv ineffective."
16986,Jung
16987,Weve been so mired in production &amp; logistics for past months. Really looking fwd to getting Semi into production.
16988,Tesla Semi delivering Tesla cars
16989,Pre-Happy birthday!
16990,"Amazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe &amp; China! Most insane logistics challenge Ive ever seen. Thanks also to many country &amp; city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated."
16991,Coming soon!
16992,No
16993,Wow
16994,This might be my finest work
16995,Duck emoji defeats Emo G Records. Crushing victory.
16996,Im disappointed that my record label failed
16997,Emo G Records
16998,Instagram comments are coding in emojis
16999,Also true
17000,True
17001,The quality of emojis varies wildly
17002,Lame
17003,C++ syntax sucks
17004,"Assert (Money == Series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency. Primary purpose == Information system for allocation of human time. As automation++, value of money--);"
17005,Even connectivity at my house in Silicon Valley sucks!
17006,Like the movie Us. Scary but also empathetic.
17007,"No, but for sure the other way around!"
17008,"Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you cant hear, but you can feel in your chest"
17009,"Were going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey."
17010,"Annoying that perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy cant. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but thats very rare."
17011,"Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block has way more performance than last years vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
17012,"Probably no fairing either &amp; just Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, tons empty) with Isp of . Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR . Spread out, see whats there. Not impossible."
17013,"Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, its slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."
17014,Anyone who bought FSD will get it
17015,"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward HW3 will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."
17016,Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon .
17017,"Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow."
17018,"We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe theres an alien artifact out there"
17019,Super cool!
17020,Good point
17021,"Tax authorities tend to interpret things in their favor, but it sure sounds like you could be right! Will investigate."
17022,"Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability."
17023,Exactly
17024,Super proud of Tesla Autopilot team!
17025,"No, it is one week either way."
17026,"I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo."
17027,It would be so inspiring for humanity to see humanity return to the moon!
17028,lbs!? How puny. Do you construct childrens toys?
17029,Thats exactly it. Youre no longer mentally fatigued after a long drive. Makes a major difference to your happiness level commuting home from work after a long day.
17030,Good point
17031,Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it
17032,"Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but were going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads."
17033,Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon.
17034,Thank you!
17035,Will do
17036,"Ford has CEOs in years &amp; nobody blinks, but Tesla loses intern &amp; its front page news. I tell ya (shakes fist at sky)"
17037,"Its possible to make a self-sustaining city on Mars by , if we start in years &amp; take orbital synchronizations"
17038,Youre most welcome! Glad to be helpful.
17039,Only when Y is in production
17040,"Every car company is constantly changing prices, but nobody cares"
17041,"Import tariffs, VAT &amp; transport costs"
17042,"To be clear, this doesnt affect Tesla website order prices. Existing inventory prices are currently slightly lower than on website. This will bring them in line."
17043,"To be precise, midnight on April , so effective April"
17044,Please note prices on all Tesla inventory cars worldwide rise by ~3% on April
17045,About to be upgraded to Chromium
17046,Reset
17047,Sentry Mode options will be: Always Exclude Home Exclude Work Exclude saved locations Ask Off
17048,"If someone has already won a Roadster from a prior program, theyre only eligible to win the signed Performance Y"
17049,Sounds like a good idea
17050,How to win the boss fight in Sekiro
17051,"No, its cumulative, but once you win one of the prizes, referral count resets to zero &amp; you cant win that prize again. Intent over time is to enable those without a massive social media presence to win."
17052,WW
17053,"Agreed, you can only win each prize once"
17054,Youre welcome!
17055,New Tesla referral program just released
17056,Why uh yes we comprehensive statistics that go deep &amp; wide
17057,Me too! He was so great. Loved Colbert Report too.
17058,Jim Cramer explains short-seller market manipulation
17059,Jim cant take the heat
17060,"Jim, no response?"
17061,Exactly
17062,"Best to get a Tesla Powerwall, so you can power your house &amp; also drive"
17063,Probably start Australia builds in late May or June &amp; start arriving in winter
17064,Coming soon
17065,"Yes, full duration"
17066,White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around Kelvin
17067,"Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach or , moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint."
17068,Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.
17069,No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
17070,Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles
17071,"Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots"
17072,Only some of the hottest sections
17073,Full size
17074,We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Dont need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
17075,"You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber."
17076,"Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations."
17077,Agreed
17078,"Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. Were simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to % would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed."
17079,"Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout"
17080,"Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely."
17081,First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
17082,Goes against interests of all Texans
17083,"Wow, this is crazy"
17084,"If someone really wants to return the car in good faith on day , thats fine"
17085,"To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after youve had your Tesla for a week"
17086,Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at .
17087,Yes!
17088,"Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades arent so crazy"
17089,"This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes dont actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules."
17090,"Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production"
17091,"Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer"
17092,"Model partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but thats a lot of complexity."
17093,"Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isnt critical for snowy regions."
17094,"Still get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice."
17095,"About a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of Tesla cyberpunk truck"
17096,End Titles from Blade Runner played after Model Y webcast cut
17097,Designed to feel much bigger on inside than it looks on outside. An incredibly important principle.
17098,"There was something, but no one caught it"
17099,It also feels way bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside
17100,"Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next! India"
17101,Yeah
17102,Exactly!
17103,London to Beijing Supercharger route
17104,Worth watching Revenge of the Electric Car. Covers rebirth of electric cars in general. Has footage before &amp; after we started production of our first car.
17105,The hardest joke ever
17106,With pie
17107,"Long-term, its about coupling the collective will of humanity to AI. Short-term, its about improving the lives of those with brain or spine problems."
17108,"Next software update will increase storm watch sensitivity. Youre right, its currently too low."
17109,Checking into this
17110,S3XY
17111,OTA
17112,Plug in a USB drive to record video
17113,"Comes with , which finishes validation this week"
17114,Looking forward to building a Boring Company tunnel in Vegas. Assuming to be operational by end of year!
17115,Yes
17116,Our list prices are our actual prices. Software (and automotive) vary prices frequently by changing the discount or rebate.
17117,"Sure, that would be great"
17118,Sure
17119,Correct
17120,Thats the plan
17121,Of course
17122,"In retrospect, lower price shouldnt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldnt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday."
17123,"However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak"
17124,"We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board."
17125,"When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought dont want to write Tesla a check. So it goes."
17126,Yes
17127,Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too
17128,Applies worldwide
17129,Yes
17130,"Tesla car prices go up ~3% next week, except for $35k Model . Order online at before then for current prices."
17131,Couldnt resolve all the rights issues. Will add another racing game soon.
17132,Ok
17133,"Yeah, it might break"
17134,Software release later this week should make it better
17135,True (sigh)
17136,True
17137,"Probably right. Starship rate of progress far exceeds Falcon &amp; Dragon, although theyre critical to getting there. dInnovation/dt is what matters long-term."
17138,"For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesnt have same safety criticality as crew."
17139,Pretty much any moon or planet that has a solid or liquid surface
17140,"Most likely, but this is contingent upon NASA review &amp; approval"
17141,"Best to use a giant brake pad, aka heat shield"
17142,No
17143,"Dragon was designed to land using thrusters, with parachutes as backup. Switched to chutes as primary, due to difficulty of proving safety, but Dragon can still do it."
17144,km/h
17145,Raptor on way to Hopper. Will be mounted to vehicle next week.
17146,NK-33 &amp; RD /180 are exceptional
17147,Thank you on behalf of SpaceX! We have always admired your rocket/spacecraft technology.
17148,Thank you on behalf of the people of SpaceX!
17149,"All good, system maintained room temperature within spacecraft"
17150,"Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator, version"
17151,Atmospheric entry at mph is like a meteor &amp; will vaporize steel. Burn marks below are on cold side. Main heatshield on bottom.
17152,"Yes, invitations go out tomorrow"
17153,Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time
17154,"We will spend or months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide."
17155,"Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from kW to +kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of best case &amp; more than for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput."
17156,"Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to % for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original Model S. Not splitting power across Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to %."
17157,So true
17158,Extremely important merch
17159,"Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm)"
17160,"Yes, but an engine shouldnt count until it flies"
17161,Ukraine did play a major role
17162,Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You wont notice it in range.
17163,"If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power"
17164,Russia has excellent rocket engineering &amp; best engine currently flying. Reusable version of their new Angara rocket would be great.
17165,"Thanks, that sounds great!"
17166,Youre most welcome. Very proud of Tesla team. Super tough years!
17167,"Oh stop, youll make me blush"
17168,Ok
17169,"Yeah, I lift a little"
17170,Tesla comms is fixing. That was a mistake.
17171,So cute!
17172,Buddy is like an Earth Pokmon
17173,"Gap in understanding is that $35k Model production *starts* this month, but will not reach volume production until mid year. Extremely difficult to predict middle part of manufacturing S-curve."
17174,Yes
17175,"No, just literally having toast &amp; jam while playing Jamming"
17176,Having toast &amp; jam in kitchen while playing Jamming by Bob Marley
17177,"Yes. Personally, Im most excited by the Tesla Truck. Maybe it will be too futuristic for most people, but I love it."
17178,"Yes, anyone will be able to take videos"
17179,I believe so
17180,"No, that unveil is later this year"
17181,Slightly higher drag * slightly higher frontal area affects air friction &amp; mass affects rolling resistance &amp; hill climb. Physics is the law.
17182,Normal
17183,Yes
17184,"Detailed specs &amp; pricing will be provided, as well as test rides in Y"
17185,"Model Y, being an SUV, is about % bigger than Model , so will cost about % more &amp; have slightly less range for same battery"
17186,Model Y unveil event on March at LA Design Studio
17187,First public Tesla V3.0 Supercharger Station goes live Wed pm
17188,"SpaceX team in Hawthorne control, Dragon docked to Station above"
17189,SpaceX Crew Dragon has docked with International
17190,"Yes, she would be able to breathe"
17191,Proximity docking sequence underway. Dragon shadow visible on on solar arrays.
17192,One day we will be there to see for ourselves
17193,F
17194,Something like this could work
17195,Everyone knows Earth is hollow
17196,I am not a dog. Heres a pic of me:
17197,Model S will be raised to mph too
17198,Thank you. May you have good luck and godspeed with your spacecraft!
17199,"Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also, thank you to , without whom this would not be possible."
17200,Power will increase on all cars. Top speed on P increases to mph. Range on RWD increases to miles.
17201,"Yes, new cars and existing fleet"
17202,Firmware update coming later this month will increase power by ~5% &amp; top speed by km/h or mph
17203,Spoiler alert: not Porsche
17204,Thank you on behalf of the many people of SpaceX
17205,Lightning bolt right before launch
17206,Earth floats gently in zero gravity
17207,SpaceX Crew Dragon recap
17208,Need to get back to SpaceX launch control. Sorry this solution isnt perfect.
17209,"Were trying to make EVs &amp; autonomy more affordable over time. This is the right thing to do. However, we cannot then also retroactively make earlier buyers whole without killing the company."
17210,Will take a few days for system update
17211,"Yeah, we need a few days to update the system. If anyone already paid $3k, they should get $1k back."
17212,"Its not exactly symmetric, but it will come with HW3 upgrade long-term"
17213,"If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k"
17214,"If you bought a Tesla before yesterdays price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less)"
17215,He is the sensor!
17216,"Nope, hes going to float around in zero gravity"
17217,Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!
17218,Happy birthday!
17219,"Yeah, just use a dryer outlet. High power, easy to install &amp; low cost."
17220,Explanation from Tesla later today
17221,Yes
17222,Haha
17223,Ripley
17224,"Base Model available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia to months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes &amp; import duties mean price may be % or more above US number."
17225,Exactly
17226,No reductions from here
17227,For sure. It fundamentally improves quality of life.
17228,Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot
17229,Exact Tesla Model in my profile pic costs $35k before incentives &amp; takes minute to buy online at
17230,I think we should do something here. Will talk with team &amp; send out a note in next few days.
17231,Should be ~5% peak power increase with March software release
17232,"Scheduled for March release, along with many other improvements"
17233,"Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways, advanced summon &amp; autopark"
17234,I was being too obvious
17235,Make the Mars Technocracy real
17236,Yay!
17237,ET phone home. No answer
17238,Some Tesla news
17239,Haha
17240,Yes
17241,Stop censoring science!
17242,Because it costs $2500 to transport to east coast &amp; everyone pays same
17243,California
17244,Thursday pm
17245,"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. Its X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, X harder."
17246,"Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
17247,"Yes, exciting potential"
17248,Exactly
17249,"Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Cant print yet."
17250,Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
17251,"Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through that were critical to SpaceXs success. Great respect &amp; appreciation!"
17252,"Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
17253,"Indeed. I have great respect for judges. Its not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."
17254,"SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states k to k. How embarrassing"
17255,Oh hi lol
17256,"Fate *loves* irony. Frankly, too much."
17257,Meetings are a valuable use of time!
17258,Theres a in my
17259,Respawn++
17260,Great meme review hosted by Will Smith
17261,Haha true
17262,Its designed to be way better. Well see what reality has to say about that.
17263,"Yes, lot of risk"
17264,"Guys, I have feelings"
17265,Focusing on Starship instead
17266,Deorbits &amp; burns up over the Pacific
17267,"Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; Dragon abort thrusters."
17268,"Including Heavy, which is cores, around or so"
17269,"Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. Thats scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
17270,"High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least or missions for Falcon . Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
17271,Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
17272,Yes
17273,Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April.
17274,Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
17275,"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
17276,SN2 has changes that should help
17277,To the first part. I doubt wed create a Dyson ring or sphere.
17278,Yes
17279,"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN , which is almost done."
17280,"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
17281,"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
17282,You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
17283,Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
17284,"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
17285,"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
17286,"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing High engine chamber pressure and ablative dont get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
17287,"Thats true Merlin A was terrible. C was ok, D good, but block Merlin (should probably be called E) is something special. Took about years to get there."
17288,"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for launch capability. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
17289,Dont know
17290,"SpaceX commercial launch market share went from % in to % in . Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years."
17291,"Exactly. Thats the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
17292,"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but Im worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
17293,So true John Clarke
17294,"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner"
17295,Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
17296,"That said, I still only own BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Dont have any crypto holdings."
17297,"I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day . Had I been better, our first launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes."
17298,"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of probably around k, ie k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about k."
17299,Wont be long before they do
17300,"Tesla made cars in , but will make around k in"
17301,Tesla cars loading in SF for Europe
17302,The gritty truth
17303,Did meme review last night with Justin Roiland from
17304,Agreed. Also needs option for automatically on all locations or if unknown location.
17305,Pics are so clear in space!
17306,That last bit gives a good sense of what orbit is like
17307,"Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI &amp; I didnt agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up &amp; it was just better to part ways on good terms."
17308,I had to focus on solving a painfully large number of engineering &amp; manufacturing problems at Tesla (especially) &amp; SpaceX
17309,"To clarify, Ive not been involved closely with OpenAI for over a year &amp; dont have mgmt or board oversight"
17310,SpaceX foundry casting Raptor engine manifold out of Inconel
17311,It will soon
17312,"Yes, Autopilot max speed is mph above speed limit off highway or mph on highway"
17313,Of course I still love you
17314,"This is in addition to existing Cabin Overheat Protection, which come on automatically at high temps to ensure any babies or pets in the car are safe"
17315,Yes
17316,"It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then, if that looks good, speed up next week. We def need to add a Request Latest Update feature!"
17317,Updating
17318,"Wow,"
17319,CNBC - Tesla Model ranked most satisfying car
17320,"True, that headline is not exactly going to win a Pulitzer for originality"
17321,"Probably a month or two. Sentry mode became top priority, so pushed that out a bit."
17322,"Some sites maintained an almost daily Tesla deathwatch years ago, reporting with an awful delight. days later"
17323,Tesla Model X first SUV to receive a perfect crash test rating via
17324,Bet the other carmakers didnt see that one coming haha
17325,"Yeah, but simpler. Needed for landing burn or engines will suck in a bubble."
17326,"Starship &amp; Super Heavy will press tanks autogenously even in version . Very important, as helium costs more than oxygen on Falcon, even though liquid oxygen is /3 vehicle mass &amp; helium weighs basically nothing."
17327,"Luke, I am your farter."
17328,"Thanks Jack, Twitter rocks!"
17329,To air is human
17330,Agreed
17331,Sorry Had a vital mission in Norway Now I am back
17332,True
17333,"Moon first, Mars as soon as the planets align"
17334,On my bedside table
17335,A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
17336,"Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress &amp; setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!"
17337,The goodwill of the public is critical to Starships success
17338,At least X cheaper
17339,"Very dependent on volume, but Im confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want."
17340,Yes
17341,"This will sound implausible, but I think theres a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon"
17342,Close
17343,"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
17344,Much above bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of to + bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
17345,"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
17346,"Yes, aiming for sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe if we get lucky."
17347,I think where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
17348,About secs
17349,Definitely! Its amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
17350,"Raptor reached bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by engine/test team!"
17351,I was simply too sexy for it
17352,Maybe tomorrow
17353,"Just left Zeebrugge, now Tilburg, then Tesla HQ in Amsterdam &amp; Oslo tonight to review service in Norway. Exciting to see thousands of Model s on their way to owners in Europe!"
17354,Hope they dont find this pic!
17355,thank goodness its not November
17356,a
17357,I want you too baby
17358,Joe Rogan describes Tesla for mins &amp; secs
17359,"Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
17360,"Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
17361,"Rocket booster temperatures wont go much above Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around K for a Mach entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
17362,Prob wise for version to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
17363,"Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
17364,"The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just Starship &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"
17365,SpaceX Engineering
17366,Telekinesis
17367,Vaporized some copper
17368,Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week
17369,"Design requires at least metric tons of force. Engine reached mT &amp; bar chamber pressure with warm propellant, which means % to % more with deep cryo."
17370,Raptor just achieved power level needed for Starship &amp; Super Heavy
17371,"Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow."
17372,Were doing everything we can to get there. Its a super hard grind.
17373,"Exactly. Both prices are shown right next to each other &amp; lower price is *actually* the real apples to apples cost vs a fuel car. In fact, for many states in the US, its way better."
17374,VAT of ~20% &amp; import duties of ~10% usually result in a % higher cost in Europe
17375,Mach Diamonds
17376,Glad you like it
17377,Spark plugs ignite dual blow torches that ignite preburners &amp; main chamber
17378,"Gaseous CH4/O2 &amp; heavy duty spark plugs. Basically, a of insane power"
17379,"Will do, although SpaceX reddit is very well-informed. Really impressive analysis by some commenters."
17380,Engine use methox torch igniters. Green tinge is either camera saturation or a tiny bit of copper from the chamber.
17381,First firing of Starship Raptor flight engine! So proud of great work by team!!
17382,We will when it rolls out
17383,Yes
17384,At Texas with engineering team getting ready to fire new Raptor rocket engine
17385,soon
17386,Only a matter of time
17387,That might be the ultimate superpower
17388,How Model performs on a long road trip
17389,"Im openly moderate. There, I said it."
17390,Haha how is this even real?
17391,"No, payload will actually increase"
17392,Exactly
17393,I do like nonsense memes. Its true.
17394,Yes
17395,Next few days
17396,looks like sentient choc ice cream
17397,Just bought oh yeah
17398,Whoa cool
17399,No plans to do so. Would recommend Model S.
17400,logarithms
17401,Dammit!
17402,"Well tweak the alloy over time, so it wont exactly be , but close"
17403,"Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart"
17404,"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesnt even need paint!"
17405,Still up to . Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
17406,Mostly true
17407,"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so wont need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
17408,Yes
17409,Initially making one metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
17410,Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at Texas
17411,Yes. Its very rare to find all three.
17412,"To be clear, Im confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding"
17413,"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
17414,"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack"
17415,Absolutely. Youve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
17416,And Tesla Gigafactory is steadily becoming self-powered by solar
17417,"About orbit synch windows, which are every months, so self-sufficiency around"
17418,All our patent are belong to you
17419,"Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the worlds factories every day"
17420,Exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market! We created Tesla to accelerate a sustainable future &amp; its happening!
17421,Tasty food!
17422,Its designed for people on a Mars journey
17423,Super appreciate Deepaks year history building Tesla &amp; wish him greatest of happiness in retirement! Zach has been outstanding over his year history with Tesla &amp; will build upon Deepaks legacy.
17424,"Sure, which ones?"
17425,Youre most welcome! Very thoughtful questions.
17426,Max Tegmark is great
17427,Entropy is the source and the end of life in this instance of the Multiverse
17428,guys standing on roof of skyscraper. st guy says updraft is so strong it blows you back on roof of you jump off. He jumps off &amp; is blown back on roof. nd guy tries &amp; goes splat. rd guy: that was a dirty trick Superman.
17429,"If heat death will be inevitable end of Universe, it actually *is* all about journey"
17430,Entropy is the ultimate boss battle
17431,Haha
17432,tbh smh
17433,Haha true
17434,SpaceX documentary actual footage
17435,"All we had back then was carpet &amp; a mariachi band. Now, SPACESHIP!!"
17436,Sure hope that happens
17437,"Great electric car documentary about early days of Tesla, GM Volt, Nissan Leaf &amp; Gadget. So much has happened since then"
17438,We are so tiny
17439,"You drive a hard bargain, but ok"
17440,Host meme review?
17441,"Its an honor, sir! Thanks for owning a Tesla."
17442,Tap Tesla logo at top of your cars touchscreen &amp; wait secs to open special features box
17443,Still my favorite tweet of all time
17444,"Ok, well throw that in too"
17445,"But, occasionally, the metal version"
17446,Haha
17447,Tesla Sentry Mode will play Bachs Toccata and Fugue during a robbery (and keep Summer safe)
17448,"All doors unlock automatically when the Tesla comes to a stop after an accident. There is both primary &amp; backup power to doors, brakes, steering &amp; airbags."
17449,Cool that this is happening on many fronts. Looks like a good design by .
17450,"Yeah, worked on my cousins farm for six weeks around my th birthday. I was so kewl."
17451,Many cold weather improvements coming via OTA software
17452,So tempting
17453,Its like looking in a mirror!
17454,That would be so cool!
17455,"Yes, and my grandfather was from Minnesota with some Scandinavian/German background. Got to hand it to Norway. Thats a great sculpture!"
17456,Awesome moose sculpture!
17457,Rough beta in to weeks
17458,Feature has now been in place for months
17459,These are industrial strength. Not recommended for use at home!
17460,Testing metallic heat shield at C (2000F)
17461,"Sure. Also, we need to be better at remembering brightness settings."
17462,The youth love em
17463,"If test flight of goes well next month, will to this summer!"
17464,Actual tanks are fine
17465,"~1750K is peak heating expected on about % of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on %. Rest drops below K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of % of the ship. Another reason for steel."
17466,I just heard. mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
17467,"S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate degrees of delta temp"
17468,Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
17469,"Since its part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it"
17470,Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot
17471,"Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels."
17472,Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
17473,"When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water"
17474,untrue
17475,Roughly to minutes for light to travel from Earth to Mars
17476,Director of CERN asked me about Boring Co building the new LHC tunnel when we were at the . Would probably save several billon Euros.
17477,Yes
17478,Blood moon over LA tonight ()
17479,The zooms around the world about every mins
17480,Tesla is the safest car according to US govt testing
17481,"I wish them well. Track record in auto startups is tough. Thousands of US auto startups, but only Ford &amp; Tesla have avoided bankruptcy. A similar scenario is likely in all countries."
17482,Wow
17483,Yup
17484,"Thanks, good idea!"
17485,"Yes, ending on Feb . Its adding too much cost to the cars, especially Model ."
17486,Order must occur before Feb
17487,"No, the whole referral incentive system will end"
17488,"The Tesla customer referral program will end on Feb . If you want to refer a friend to buy a Tesla &amp; give them months of free Supercharging, please do so before then."
17489,I think some of them should combine forces. Talent is spread too thin.
17490,"Dragon was originally designed to land with thrusters, but its not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings"
17491,How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
17492,"Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX"
17493,"The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication"
17494,"The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport."
17495,Haha youre welcome! Hope youre doing well.
17496,"About $15M/km for a two way high speed transit, so probably around $750M plus maybe $50M/station"
17497,Glad you like it
17498,Yes
17499,LA is so beautiful after the rain
17500,SpaceX Dragon from as seen from viewport
17501,Falcon comes home
17502,We are not yet offering the mid range Model in Europe
17503,"Which country? There is a % import duty, ~20% VAT (US prices dont include sales tax) and about $2000 in extra shipping cost, but it shouldnt add up to $25k."
17504,View of SpaceX Dragon berthed with in the last Cupola opening. Dragon (Crew Dragon) launching soon.
17505,Ok
17506,Obv must be more pointy tho
17507,It needed to be made real
17508,Haha
17509,Starship Hopper will do vertical flight tests similar to the Falcon Hopper
17510,Body/tank diameter is m or about ft
17511,Should be done with first orbital prototype around June
17512,Yes
17513,Yes
17514,Yes
17515,"This is for suborbital VTOL tests. Orbital version is taller, has thicker skins (wont wrinkle) &amp; a smoothly curving nose section."
17516,"Starship test flight rocket just finished assembly at the Texas launch site. This is an actual picture, not a rendering."
17517,Yes
17518,Getting some regulatory pushback. May not be available in all regions.
17519,Going through final validation &amp; regulatory approval. Probably releases to early access program owners in a few weeks. Its trippy!
17520,Yes
17521,Tesla *with* Autopilot engaged is twice as safe &amp; continues to make steady improvements
17522,Def not
17523,Yes
17524,"Starting on Monday, Tesla will no longer be taking orders for the kWh version of the Model S &amp; X. If youd like that version, please order by Sunday night at"
17525,Good idea
17526,Its an option
17527,Vertically or horizontally?
17528,No problem
17529,"Plus, you can basically accelerate at the limit of human endurance"
17530,I dont think the law fully anticipated this situation. So probably yes for a while.
17531,Im not. Will use SpaceX cold gas thruster system with ultra high pressure air in a composite over-wrapped pressure vessel in place of the rear seats.
17532,It will be
17533,"Btw, you can buy a Tesla online in less than mins &amp; give it back for a full refund for any reason"
17534,The new Roadster will actually do something like this
17535,And now we dance!
17536,Great thread
17537,"Shanghai Giga will produce affordable versions of /Y for greater China. All Model S/X &amp; higher cost versions of Model /Y will still be built in US for WW market, incl China."
17538,"Shanghai Giga output is just for greater China, not North America. Affordable cars must be made on same continent as customers."
17539,Shanghai Giga production of Model /Y will serve greater China region
17540,"Aiming to finish initial construction this summer, start Model production end of year &amp; reach high volume production next year"
17541,Looking forward to breaking ground on the Shanghai Gigafactory today!
17542,Good sign that almost no Model owners want to sell their cars!
17543,"Yes, will be extremely intense. Early flights are especially dangerous, as theres a lot of new hardware."
17544,"Sorry, to be clear, this pic is all real. Nothing rendered."
17545,Falcon on launch pad with Crew Dragon &amp; new astronaut walkway
17546,"Spiral-winding is great for uniform thickness. We used that for the Hyperloop vacuum tunnel. However, Starship skin thickness will vary considerably according to loads."
17547,Exactly
17548,Its all in the way you say it
17549,Matt DeBord reviews all Tesla models via
17550,I do love Tintin
17551,More on this in a few months
17552,"Starship test vehicle under assembly will look similar to this illustration when finished. Operational Starships would obv have windows, etc."
17553,"Aiming for weeks, which probably means weeks, due to unforeseen issues"
17554,"Good shot of Starship flight test vehicle being assembled in Boca Chica, Texas"
17555,Engines currently on Starship hopper are a blend of Raptor development &amp; operational parts. First hopper engine to be fired is almost finished assembly in California. Probably fires next month.
17556,Haha
17557,Not yet
17558,Thats a reasonable question
17559,About a month away from the first orbital test flight of crew Dragon
17560,Probably
17561,Thats what I heard
17562,Life is made of ups &amp; downs

17578,"Sounds great, will connect you with Tesla Energy"
17579,Singapore has enough area to switch to solar/battery &amp; be energy-independent
17580,"Yes, support of the Chinese government is very much appreciated"
17581,Govt has been unwelcome
17582,Congratulations!
17583,Great work by Tesla Team!
17584,Congratulations team!!
17585,Thanks!
17586,Haha
17587,Haha
17588,Hope everyone has a happy New Year!
17589,Happy New Year!
17590,"Good summary of Tesla progress in by (due to Tesla team, not me though) via"
17591,Thanks Tesla owners in China! Looking forward to visiting soon for the groundbreaking of Gigafactory Shanghai!
17592,"Turns out if you take Dayquil, you exit The Matrix"
17593,Excited to have Larry Ellison &amp; Kathleen Wilson-Thompson join the Tesla board!
17594,Ok
17595,Tesla team did a great job!
17596,Yes
17597,I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April
17598,Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
17599,Exactly
17600,Yes
17601,Probability at % &amp; rising rapidly due to new architecture
17602,Congratulations
17603,Coming soon
17604,Yes
17605,Got it
17606,"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico."
17607,Yep
17608,Yes
17609,"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to % of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
17610,"Most people dont know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
17611,We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
17612,Ok
17613,Wow!
17614,"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
17615,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:"
17616,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because its electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
17617,"There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"
17618,Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in days! Order online at to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
17619,Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!!
17620,"No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ..."
17621,"Thanks, hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent."
17622,Sigh
17623,Yes
17624,"Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side"
17625,Glad youre ok!
17626,Starship will look like liquid silver
17627,Haha
17628,Maybe
17629,Much less
17630,Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.
17631,"Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better"
17632,"Yes, signal acquired from that dish"
17633,Stainless Steel Starship
17634,Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
17635,When its no longer noticeable over Plancks length
17636,Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earths gravitational reach is infinite. Zero gravity is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
17637,At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
17638,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
17639,Engineering is true magic
17640,Yezzz
17641,How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
17642,Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities
17643,Please put invented car fart on my gravestone. This is my only request.
17644,Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
17645,"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."
17646,Thanks!
17647,"Its embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
17648,You def dont want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need horsepower per engine. Thats not a typo.
17649,"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to bar. That is a mad level."
17650,Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
17651,"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
17652,"Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word star or link"
17653,"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars."
17654,Coldformed at cryo
17655,"This test hopper is at full body diameter of m / ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter."
17656,Were building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
17657,Exactly
17658,"For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry."
17659,Yes
17660,"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle were building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
17661,"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; were using a different alloy mix. I super Series Stainless!"
17662,"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
17663,"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
17664,"If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
17665,Coming soon
17666,"It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model orders delivered by year end"
17667,Try connecting to WiFi
17668,"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer cant take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in days. Order online at or visit stores."
17669,Only if Dawkins joins
17670,Interesting
17671,Bajirao Mastani
17672,"Anxiety is a scalar, fear is a vector"
17673,Yes
17674,Haha
17675,Namaste
17676,Needs a warmup
17677,Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every minutes! Hope you have a Merry Christmas!
17678,"Thanks, will consider next year"
17679,"So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this wont matter for the first few layers"
17680,Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in mins with a few taps. No more need to call!
17681,"As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a after them haha"
17682,"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that built a ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally X better, should be operational next year. For reference:"
17683,Join our underground movement!
17684,"Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out"
17685,Ok
17686,Autopilot doesnt need the guide wheels. Theyre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
17687,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
17688,Exactly
17689,"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
17690,"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
17691,"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
17692,"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think theyre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
17693,"Youre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didnt include it. Were working on one that makes things clear."
17694,"Pop up, park and walk!"
17695,I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding rd St.
17696,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"
17697,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety."
17698,Next step for Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is vehicles/hour at mph (250km/h).
17699,Precisely
17700,Presentation starting at :15
17701,"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
17702,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start"
17703,"Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but its time to upgrade to something better."
17704,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
17705,"Capable of traveling safely at over mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
17706,Yes
17707,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
17708,Tesla in tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
17709,Boring product launch will be streamed live at pm California time tonight
17710,Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
17711,Same applies to those who didnt order PUP
17712,Exactly. Its a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
17713,"Yeah, I wrote that back in , almost years ago!"
17714,"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers &amp; cell phones. It takes many design iterations &amp; vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability."
17715,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
17716,Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiels Founders Fund: we have no concerns whatsoever.
17717,"Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
17718,Tis
17719,Medieval Futurism
17720,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
17721,Thanks!
17722,The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats &amp; just wipe it off.
17723,Congratulations!
17724,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in weeks, even if you havent placed an order yet"
17725,You got it
17726,Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build &amp; interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
17727,Zero Suit
17728,God Fire
17729,ramen is sooo good
17730,Exactly
17731,This part is true. I was trying to explain that we dont want our cars to have a tinny sound.
17732,You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
17733,Seems likely that well be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though
17734,"Incorrect. Chairman is an honorific, not executive role, which means its not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in years. Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut provided I have the support of shareholders."
17735,About to days
17736,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get days to return for full refund vs day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
17737,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla cant deliver your car this year."
17738,No need to wait. Its super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
17739,Im dying to make a pickup truck so bad we might have a prototype to unveil next year
17740,Yes
17741,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they dont believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they dont need to be."
17742,Probably next month
17743,Youre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story.
17744,"Were opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
17745,Probably end of next year
17746,So true
17747,This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
17748,"Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
17749,We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
17750,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over X the image processing ability."
17751,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
17752,"If you have a Tesla built in past years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps."
17753,Machete!!
17754,"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had % of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
17755,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car -2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldnt exist or would have started much later."
17756,"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China."
17757,"Buying took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didnt like even when we were only making ."
17758,"Tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late . Hed originally filed for it in . Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
17759,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
17760,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
17761,Yes
17762,Interesting
17763,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
17764,The new design is metal
17765,"As far as we know, its the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesnt need heat shielding or even paint."
17766,Boring Company product launch on Dec . More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
17767,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
17768,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
17769,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
17770,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
17771,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
17772,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
17773,Falcon/Dragon launch to in minutes
17774,Us too sigh
17775,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
17776,satellites on this flight!
17777,"Were adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
17778,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if theres no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
17779,It is so hard to move in armor!
17780,Youre all hired!
17781,Yes no maybe
17782,None shall pass!
17783,Ok
17784,Good advice
17785,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. Were also working on vision-only driving.
17786,Glad youre ok
17787,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
17788,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly % range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
17789,"Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
17790,You got it!
17791,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
17792,No
17793,No
17794,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Cant wipe it off."
17795,Haha
17796,"Prof Dahn is correct (hes great), but the relative benefit is small. Id recommend % more SoC for convenience."
17797,"Not worth going below % imo. Even % is still fine. Also, no issue going to % or lower SoC."
17798,True
17799,Both
17800,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
17801,One day
17802,"Were doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but were just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
17803,Update soon
17804,Sorry
17805,Boring breakthrough
17806,Definitely
17807,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
17808,We tried. Nintendo wont license it to us.
17809,That would be cool
17810,Haha kinda true
17811,Never heard of it
17812,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games."
17813,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
17814,Yes
17815,"This is completely backwards. Based on what weve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, were moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Wont need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
17816,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
17817,Tiny wizard
17818,to years
17819,"Engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
17820,Touch
17821,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesnt feel like work"
17822,"Varies per person, but about sustained, peaking above at times. Pain level increases exponentially above ."
17823,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on hours a week"
17824,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then , , &amp; are the places to be."
17825,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
17826,liters of pure water costs $1
17827,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
17828,Ah yes fair point
17829,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
17830,Not yet
17831,trouble
17832,Earth is
17833,"Earths crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava"
17834,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is % water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as its all land. Even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about /3 land."
17835,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
17836,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks &amp; heatshield"
17837,"If you dont want a Tesla, heres a list of all electric cars in North America via"
17838,Signing off for a while
17839,Happy Thanksgiving!!
17840,Starships were meant to fly
17841,Starship Tooters
17842,Good one
17843,Good idea
17844,Coming soon
17845,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
17846,Should be next week
17847,"No, its the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon"
17848,Later versions will
17849,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earths deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
17850,Renaming BFR to Starship
17851,"No, were just going to accelerate BFR"
17852,Yes
17853,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
17854,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of % to % of population in all active markets.
17855,"No, its got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about % to % of effort, all things considered."
17856,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
17857,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
17858,"Lot on our plate, so its either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
17859,Ok
17860,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. Thats a great van. We will inquire.
17861,Absolutely agree
17862,Investigating
17863,Probably mid
17864,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
17865,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
17866,Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
17867,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
17868,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
17869,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
17870,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
17871,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isnt needed
17872,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with or taps
17873,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive."
17874,Radical change
17875,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
17876,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
17877,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to in Model for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
17878,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
17879,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
17880,Missed miku concert sigh
17881,Listening to Better Now
17882,"China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation &amp; transport"
17883,"Sure hope this isnt true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
17884,Haha
17885,Looking back at the sun from upper stage &amp; Falcon landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
17886,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for min bulk discount.
17887,While (!castle) {brick++};
17888,Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
17889,Fortnite irl
17890,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
17891,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
17892,Not much but it is ours
17893,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
17894,"We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains dont leave often."
17895,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
17896,Yes
17897,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
17898,We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
17899,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
17900,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, its better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
17901,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model can be delivered in US by Dec if ordered by Nov
17902,We will fight Big Tequila!
17903,That would be awesome
17904,Easily accessible energy
17905,Send me a note!
17906,Would be fun to add to Tesla
17907,Yes
17908,Will try again next month
17909,"Congratulations team! Thanks , much appreciated."
17910,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever."
17911,Is he ok?
17912,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
17913,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
17914,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
17915,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for grant money. They earn vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
17916,"That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
17917,"We know well run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far"
17918,Because people on the ground know more about whats actually needed than politicians do
17919,"Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model ."
17920,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
17921,"Fair point, will reenable"
17922,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
17923,Please lmk what youd most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
17924,Cool
17925,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
17926,Yes
17927,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
17928,"No, were building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
17929,Wont land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we cant test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
17930,Aiming for orbital flight by June
17931,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship
17932,But comments are
17933,LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec . Runs parallel to freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to .
17934,"I think Twitter is deleting fake, scam or maybe even inactive accounts. My follower count decreased by ~20k over the past few days."

17943,Oh hi guys lol
17944,"Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent"
17945,"Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating &amp; decelerating"
17946,So underappreciated
17947,Ok
17948,Ok
17949,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec . Will be very one-dimensional.
17950,"Sounds like pure luxury! When I said sponge, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with trillion siblings."
17951,What is love?
17952,Bikini Bottom
17953,Fair
17954,"Yes, that is how"
17955,We didnt even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
17956,Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
17957,Wow thats cool!
17958,Kids these days have it easy
17959,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
17960,Haha
17961,First movie I ever saw in theaters
17962,When the only existing life was a sponge
17963,Although it was in the precambrian era
17964,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.
17965,Theyre great! Honored to work with them.
17966,Yes
17967,Definitely
17968,"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
17969,"Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in"
17970,"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
17971,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
17972,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
17973,"Amazing results by at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
17974,Prob to weeks
17975,v true
17976,cute
17977,Haha
17978,Bring Me the Horizon
17979,Aiming for next week
17980,Norway
17981,"r wrong, but in Tesla makes s overseas &amp; East Coast in st half of quarter"
17982,"Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway"
17983,We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
17984,Hahaha &lt;ahem&gt;
17985,Um yes
17986,"Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon &amp; say whos the pet now"
17987,"Also, youll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"
17988,Car will drive to your phone location &amp; follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
17989,"Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
17990,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
17991,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm its valid &amp; park."
17992,Cool haha
17993,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer &amp; secretary. Guess I have to keep st one or it will confuse the authorities."
17994,"Good point, might put that one back"
17995,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. Im now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
17996,Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
17997,"Dont worry, well make it right"
17998,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Cant wait.
17999,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
18000,"Its a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action"
18001,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of production hell sounds like a sure thing!?"
18002,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
18003,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
18004,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
18005,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
18006,Didnt you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers dont get that.
18007,Exactly. Thats Monday.
18008,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
18009,"No, but I will"
18010,Isnt it obvious?
18011,Worth it
18012,True
18013,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
18014,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
18015,Haha
18016,"On Insta, % of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get %."
18017,Lacks scale
18018,"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
18019,"Reddits twitter account is lame, because its not real Reddit"
18020,Exactly
18021,Youre right. Earlier Model Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
18022,"On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. Its great."
18023,Glad youre ok
18024,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model , so bikes can fit in trunk"
18025,Hey thats my Halloween costume!
18026,Good question
18027,"Clearly, youre not reading my twitter"
18028,I wish
18029,Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases.
18030,Yes Zorbix
18031,"Sir, I would never"
18032,"Yes, I am a little girl. Ok, not that little. Or a girl."
18033,Making progress

18049,Not moths tho
18050,Send me ur dankest memes!!
18051,in
18052,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
18053,Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
18054,"Model was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model was product alone."
18055,Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldnt be here without you.
18056,Same
18057,Howd they know!?
18058,Around mid
18059,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
18060,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
18061,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldnt look like a radiator grill opening.
18062,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that theres no such thing as a Tesla refresh. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
18063,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov . Order now to be sure of the one you want."
18064,"Model body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
18065,Working on it
18066,That is correct
18067,Twitter thought I got hacked &amp; locked my account haha

18072,Former
18073,Will be in next point release
18074,"Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country."
18075,Good point
18076,Interesting
18077,"This is a ~ ft demo tunnel. First operational, high-speed tunnel still set for Chicago, pending regulatory approvals."
18078,Under LA (Hawthorne)
18079,mph | km/h
18080,Opening event that night &amp; free rides for the public next day
18081,"Pretty close, actually"
18082,I think real
18083,Opens Dec
18084,The first tunnel is almost done
18085,N00B!
18086,Twitter is Dark Souls of social media. Reddit is Bloodborne. Insta is Zelda.
18087,Good idea!
18088,"This game is my personal favorite, but I am biased towards space stuff"
18089,Coming soon
18090,Turn on enhanced security via the settings page. This will require entering a passcode to use the car.
18091,Digital Style!
18092,Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time?
18093,BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. Its time people knew.
18094,"No, bored me, I will not"
18095,Maybe phone as controller
18096,Exactly
18097,Coming
18098,Yes
18099,Reality is hard
18100,Online doesnt count
18101,Coming soon
18102,No
18103,Thats next
18104,Had to been done ur welcome
18105,I hope this is true!
18106,"If you dont like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
18107,Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
18108,"Model long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
18109,"Its kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
18110,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just dont use sport/summer tires."
18111,"Its a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
18112,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model &amp; super simple new order page"
18113,Week or two
18114,Love the Reddit comments too
18115,Dog saves her puppies
18116,y
18117,Youll see
18118,Tomorrow brings a lemur
18119,Special Circumstances
18120,Yes
18121,New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
18122,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
18123,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
18124,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
18125,Just reviewed Teslas service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within to months.
18126,Insightful article by David
18127,"Thanks John, really admire you too! I think youre one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
18128,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
18129,I believe its $5k
18130,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
18131,Somewhere between % &amp; %
18132,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
18133,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
18134,Still a long way to go
18135,Model motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
18136,Works best if you play games full screen &amp; use steering wheel scroller balls for control
18137,Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now
18138,What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start.
18139,Yes
18140,Thanks for recognizing the great work of the Tesla team! people now.

18147,Towelie
18148,Good idea!
18149,Whole beer keg fits in Model trunk!
18150,"Wow, mechanical logic gates"
18151,Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
18152,Maybe wise to bring it just in case
18153,About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth &amp; half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens &amp; we destroy ourselves
18154,You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Dont have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
18155,Yes
18156,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."
18157,Visual approximation
18158,Teslaquila coming soon
18159,Glad youre safe
18160,Beautiful picture
18161,"Yes, its hard to find. Not sure why."
18162,"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSAs *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
18163,This is incorrect
18164,At Falcon LZ-1 Vandenberg on Sunday night with the Base Commander. Support of much appreciated.

18166,Punctuality is not my strong suit
18167,Wed be nothing without our fans
18168,Because is obviously louder than
18169,No such thing as a full refresh at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
18170,It sure does. Very reliable.
18171,You are right
18172,A reminder of why its important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power

18186,"Actually, its of forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. External cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked."
18187,Fair point
18188,"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to % of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as theyre just passive managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
18189,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
18190,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
18191,Only if theyre extremely tiny
18192,We dont judge. Any pic you want!

18195,First Falcon land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!
18196,The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
18197,"The big funds can &amp; will, as theyre suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for passive index tracking."
18198,"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
18199,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, dont realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
18200,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
18201,I hope to be less wrong over time
18202,Youre most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
18203,What they do should be illegal
18204,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
18205,Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
18206,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model actually outsold Camry by a factor of two"
18207,This is amazing
18208,Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to more users a few days ago.
18209,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
18210,"If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
18211,"Hang in there. If you are truly long-term, it will be fine."
18212,True
18213,Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? Its what they do.
18214,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
18215,Great verdict
18216,Could be worse
18217,"Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar &amp; side repeater camera neural nets just right."
18218,Something especially weird going on with Yahoo news feed on iPhone stocks app. Almost always super negative. Maybe getting gamed.
18219,Naughty by Nature
18220,Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
18221,Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
18222,That was intense
18223,i
18224,!! Will take action.
18225,And remember
18226,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
18227,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
18228,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
18229,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay!
18230,What would be great is original Elite
18231,Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
18232,Tesla Owners
18233,"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
18234,"Apologies, were upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
18235,Tricky one
18236,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners whod like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
18237,Probably for a base to be built
18238,Mars Base Alpha
18239,"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
18240,"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have % on front, % on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
18241,Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at
18242,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
18243,A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
18244,"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
18245,"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
18246,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
18247,"Exactly, all star are *not* the same, as the videos show. star just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
18248,Haha true
18249,. will post final safety probability stats soon. Model has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
18250,"Wow, glad theyre ok!"
18251,Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
18252,Tesla Rangers!
18253,"engines, but with room to add more down the road. Kinda have to."
18254,"Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldnt spend computing power on sound"
18255,Yes

18276,Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
18277,Thank you for your trust in the team. Greatly appreciated.
18278,Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
18279,Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. Its not sustainable long-term.
18280,Very interesting
18281,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night"

18297,Yes
18298,"Yeah, thats our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
18299,"Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting s of makes &amp; models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
18300,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
18301,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
18302,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"

18425,Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that its contingent on a shareholder vote.
18426,Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
18427,"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every months or so (like SpaceX)"
18428,No change
18429,Shareholders could either to sell at or hold shares &amp; go private
18430,Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
18431,My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if were private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelitys SpaceX investment.
18432,Yes
18433,I dont have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldnt expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I wont be selling in either scenario.

18538,No kidding
18539,"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
18540,"Phew . Yeah, we had a drain block months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
18541,I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
18542,"Figuratively, literally or both?"
18543,That has always been our goal
18544,"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. Other US refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
18545,"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over S/X and Model *new* net orders."
18546,Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get sec -60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
18547,"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"
18548,I wish
18549,"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."

18552,I have never donated to a SuperPAC

18555,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
18556,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
18557,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
18558,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesnt mean Im moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I dont understand why they are not important to everyone."

18592,So true
18593,The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave . They stopped shortly after boys were rescued &amp; water level rose to roof level all way back to cave . That was great work.
18594,Sounds good
18595,Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
18596,It will happen for sure. Damn.
18597,Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
18598,Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isnt. Wonder why.
18599,"Damn, now I want donuts"
18600,Yeah
18601,Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
18602,"Youre right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but theyve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."
18603,Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
18604,"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint.com, but Im in China so that wont be working until tomorrow."
18605,Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
18606,Great move
18607,Why sir
18608,Stockholm: its not just a syndrome
18609,Good point
18610,"Definitely. Cant wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
18611,"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
18612,Well it looked smaller on paper
18613,"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big"
18614,"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
18615,It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
18616,Makes a lot of sense
18617,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now its there for anyone who needs it in future. Somethings messed up if this is not a good thing.
18618,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
18619,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
18620,Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
18621,Please lmk results of your water tests
18622,"When youre there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
18623,Should be very soon. Weve already made around Model Performance cars for test drives in stores.
18624,Exactly
18625,"No, it means I created jobs for people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"
18626,Already have
18627,"Ironically, the billionaire label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasnt called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
18628,"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time."
18629,"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
18630,"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time."
18631,"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as rescue chief) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
18632,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
18633,Ok
18634,Just returned from Cave . Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
18635,That would be cool. I wonder what its like under all that ice.
18636,A second one that is cm shorter is almost complete
18637,Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
18638,"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
18639,Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
18640,"Thanks, but weve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
18641,"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
18642,Tube diameter is cm
18643,"Mini-sub arriving in about hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
18644,Thanks for letting us use your pool
18645,It is an honor to work with them
18646,"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
18647,I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz
18648,It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
18649,"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
18650,"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player."
18651,"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
18652,Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. Theyre prevented from sliding off by the diver handhold attachments.
18653,"Testing for more hours in LA, then its on a plane to Thailand"
18654,"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to X cave water pressure."
18655,I am an engineer
18656,Tight control code is always C
18657,Python is done right. Great name story too.
18658,"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"
18659,Python
18660,Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
18661,Turbo
18662,C
18663,"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we couldve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."
18664,"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
18665,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.
18666,Yes
18667,Yes
18668,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
18669,Yes
18670,"handles/hitch points on front &amp; on rear. air tank connections on front &amp; on rear, allowing to tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
18671,Im in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
18672,"Construction complete in about hours, then hour flight to Thailand"
18673,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
18674,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
18675,Ground winds would
18676,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. Its a beast.
18677,Cant be too buoyant
18678,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
18679,Good idea
18680,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
18681,Youre welcome. Happy birthday!
18682,"Yeah, thats what Im talking about in that tweet double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
18683,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
18684,Its open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
18685,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
18686,I would def recommend this
18687,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
18688,Interesting
18689,"Great, thanks"
18690,Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
18691,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water wont come in"
18692,"Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
18693,SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
18694,"Looks like st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. nd &amp; rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
18695,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob X to X more power."
18696,Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
18697,"Walking speed is around km/h, but if youre in an air tube, time doesnt matter much. If tube diameter was m, a fast walk of km would take mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
18698,Maybe worth trying: insert a m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the cm hole.
18699,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
18700,"I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
18701,I didnt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots dont work for me. They just dont like hypocrites.
18702,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I dont use Facebook.
18703,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was dancing her face off with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
18704,Why did publish a love letter puff piece about Chanoss cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
18705,. posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption Love both these dudes. Doesnt sound very objective
18706,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
18707,Are you % certain that stands by &amp; supports everything shes done? Why wont Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
18708,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
18709,True
18710,"So publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Teslas most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is one of the greatest. Her articles print Chanoss view verbatim. This is not journalism."
18711,". You stated publicly that you see eye to eye with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
18712,What a coincidence
18713,Am not attacking all media or even all of . Just asked if you inform public about an analysts prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
18714,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: , did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
18715,"Exactly. , I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
18716,"Strange. , is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analysts track record before hearing their opinion."
18717,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
18718,"Sounds very sketchy if true. , is it possible youre serving as an inside trading source for one of Teslas biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
18719,"has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
18720,"Wow, so of wrote article that misled public about Model production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work &amp; ."
18721,"., why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
18722,". is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie /week. Tesla built S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."
18723,Happy to support
18724,"Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. Dont know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps."
18725,Belfast is beautiful

18796,Then you will really hate that Tesla scored /100 four years in a row on LGBTQ equality
18797,We must aspire to truth
18798,Important to read the Wash Post article. The unable to account for number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a day period.
18799,Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
18800,True
18801,"We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate"
18802,"of the children, remained where they were placed, had moved, had run away and five were deported. That left migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHSs phone calls after days does not mean the children are missing"
18803,"All children were resettled by HHS. After days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in cases, the parents or guardians did not respond"
18804,This Washington Post article seems good
18805,"As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death &amp; hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe &amp; open to all."
18806,"This doesnt take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla."

18874,Exactly
18875,"Hes obv wrong. Forcing function for any % mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."
18876,Great name. A little on the nose.
18877,"Thats really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what money is."
18878,"Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of % seems about right. Below % is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above % too negatively affects economic output."

18901,Shelter
18902,Youre probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down.
18903,Im at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. Its big.
18904,They look beautiful
18905,Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
18906,Its actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
18907,Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
18908,They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And its way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
18909,No
18910,"Needed another general assembly line to reach k/week Model production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much"
18911,"Youre welcome, bad fiction writer"
18912,"Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW cant even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer."
18913,Your union brothers
18914,You wont find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
18915,"Thanks, good advice"
18916,They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
18917,Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software Im driving.
18918,Cant wait for the new season to start!
18919,"Weve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via rd parties."
18920,Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
18921,"Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show."
18922,"I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America."
18923,They started it &amp; attacked me personally
18924,Search UAW and corruption. Very long reading list. Great organization.
18925,Profit just means you earned more money than you spent &amp; certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla years &amp; were almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt.
18926,They dont seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
18927,Engels wrote nd &amp; rd volumes based on Marxs notes. Less reliable.
18928,"Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware."

18934,"I dont want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past."
18935,You think all companies are bad and all unions good? Thats a very bigoted position.
18936,Well said
18937,Then youll be fine
18938,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
18939,"...which clearly doesnt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of whats happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so theyre getting desperate."
18940,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
18941,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
18942,How big is your short position? Just curious.
18943,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guys claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
18944,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in . Tesla can only hire % of applicants, so must be doing something right."
18945,"UAW doesnt have % of signatures (about people) needed for a vote. They cant even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, theyre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
18946,"Im not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company cant compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Dont want Tesla to die too."
18947,"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."

18969,"Very appealing if youre a sophomore in college. Its a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness."

18974,Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of st Model dual motor performance coming off the line

18976,Yes

19012,Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
19013,"Of course, but its the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; were never going to make them again."
19014,"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a seater instead of a +2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
19015,"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. Its what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust literally bulletproof."
19016,Not recommended for urban environments
19017,Yes
19018,"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what Im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
19019,It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
19020,Love this design. Simpler the better.
19021,Add an R for Roadster
19022,"Sigh. This is crux of matter: cant make system too annoying or people wont use it, negatively affecting safety, but also cant allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
19023,A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model production reaches k/week steady.
19024,"Yes. Hopefully, Im not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
19025,Will do
19026,"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but theres no escaping Newtons Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
19027,"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we dont think there will be another."
19028,"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
19029,"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the halo crown effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
19030,"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version . To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
19031,"This is why Im not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then Id know everythings fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh"
19032,"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
19033,years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
19034,"In early s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That companys name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
19035,"Thats quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In , we open-sourced all Tesla patents"
19036,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps."
19037,"More background: I arrived in North America at w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)"
19038,"We dont think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
19039,"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
19040,"years ago, when my st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way"
19041,"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly"
19042,"Terms &amp; conditions for Not-a-Flamethrower Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple &amp; concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham."
19043,"Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: Not a Flamethrower."
19044,Yes
19045,Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher. Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
19046,"Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty match to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs."

19050,First Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today!
19051,Were building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome
19052,Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model Performance version.
19053,Gigafactory should be on % renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
19054,"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with % larger inner diameter"
19055,And were definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
19056,"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form"
19057,Running track in BF Spaceship will look something like this
19058,"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model cars."
19059,Working on improving
19060,"No way mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, mins is obv right."
19061,"Oh please, thats obv overkill"
19062,Tip of the day

19070,Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
19071,You should get an invite to configure in next few days
19072,Definitely
19073,"Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob wont offer Model leases for to months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
19074,Model Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. Its a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model cars in stores within to weeks.

19085,Actually true!
19086,"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
19087,"But dont worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everythings just fine"
19088,"Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each cars exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
19089,The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
19090,Glad youre ok!
19091,Some details on the Tesla air filtration system
19092,Mid for RHD
19093,That sounds like a fun adventure!

19095,"Model should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little on S/X."
19096,"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind"
19097,"Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model ."

19106,Hi !
19107,Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
19108,Hell of a week
19109,Just for perspective
19110,"True, no one is perfect"
19111,Youre most welcome. More to come in this regard.
19112,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism."
19113,"Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day , but theres always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure % below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
19114,Prob
19115,Yes
19116,"All items below will go to all Model s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say bug report followed by issue description."
19117,Pneumatic means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
19118,"Braking &amp; UI upgrades apply to all Model s. Improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless youre really bothered by them, dont replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. psi is best range, but lower comfort."
19119,"Yeah, absolutely"
19120,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from . Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.
19121,Like you guys too
19122,"Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."
19123,"Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should."
19124,Good progress. Really proud of this design &amp; SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
19125,Peace

19127,"At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all."
19128,"Youre saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a good person?"
19129,This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!
19130,"Nano is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Wouldve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
19131,"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying Im against science is like saying Beyonc doesnt know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
19132,"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didnt set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I dont have the right to deny false accusations? Thats messed up."
19133,"Youve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that Im against science, then cherrypicked tweets that dont represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
19134,Great book. Read it when it came out.
19135,Exactly
19136,SpaceX has Area at Cape Canaveral. Thats better than .
19137,Yeah

19140,Yes
19141,"There are no aliens. Officially, at least"
19142,You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
19143,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money."
19144,I really want to make this cupholder
19145,"A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size &amp; stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp &amp; dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice."
19146,Ive literally had dreams about cup holder designs
19147,Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
19148,Youre welcome. Appreciate the letter.

19152,"Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isnt showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by powerful people &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media."
19153,Thanks
19154,Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
19155,"Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by powerful people that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
19156,Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
19157,Youre right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off
19158,Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
19159,Youre missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesnt trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Dont believe me? Run your own poll
19160,"Youre welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming Im against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
19161,You really think I havent spent time in a newsroom? Ive spent time in too many. Bleak.
19162,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
19163,"Yup, deleted"
19164,? It should
19165,"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You wont notice sport brakes unless youre on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky tires."
19166,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks for excellent critical feedback!"
19167,"Yes, Model Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes"
19168,Keyword future
19169,Will do another rev before final design
19170,I was
19171,Thats what I had in mind
19172,Sometimes even I think were the same person!
19173,"Nanotech *is* bs imo. When you take something that has nothing to do w gender &amp; make it about that, you devalue genuine gender issues."
19174,"About to ship. holding flamethrower pickup parties in a week or so, then deliveries begin. Check for details."
19175,Its not
19176,Thats a great song!
19177,"Sometimes when I have hurt feelings, I play this song"
19178,"No, thats the other guy"
19179,So true
19180,Because Twitter is fun
19181,USAToday FTW!
19182,Dank is wack unless youre on weed
19183,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this non-journalist who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
19184,But femtotech is the future
19185,Nanotech is so . Picotech is times better.
19186,"Yeah, thats exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."
19187,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
19188,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that dumb public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
19189,A Tesla has a usable reserve of to miles range even after the battery reads empty. This will not hurt the pack.
19190,"Pretty good. TinTin A &amp; B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."
19191,"Its cool for kids &amp; if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a rocket scientist in aerospace, they would think youre"
19192,I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away &amp; our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause
19193,Does the psych ward know you smuggled in a mobile phone?
19194,The pain will end
19195,"Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening"
19196,Gwynne has been prez of SpaceX for years &amp; well-deserved
19197,"Stop trying to charm me. It wont work. Ok, maybe a little Are you a real person or a bot?"
19198,"Using rocket science non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on"
19199,What are you talking about? Youre being incredibly rude &amp; nonsensical.
19200,"Wow, havent watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
19201,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
19202,Cant believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
19203,"We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"
19204,Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
19205,Prob end of next year
19206,"Good point, we will add that to the construction plan"
19207,"Global map of Tesla Superchargers, including those coming soon"
19208,"Earths rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
19209,Youre making my point. Its tragic that theres a national nano day. I wish I didnt know that.
19210,All four. Zone throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
19211,Model was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
19212,This is the new production line for battery module Zone . Will play a key role in getting from /week to /week for Model .
19213,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
19214,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in when we were just figuring things out."
19215,Worth a shot
19216,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. Its called satire
19217,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
19218,"Problem solved, was able to buy ! Game on"
19219,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didnt correct me on this!"
19220,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd"
19221,"Turns out is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
19222,"For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
19223,"Tried to buy , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
19224,"Definitely did not. Ive been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
19225,Ive just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. Its amazing that you dont understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
19226,The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; were not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings Ive ever met. Youre the former.
19227,No
19228,Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.
19229,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that havent been unveiled yet. You dont have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
19230,"Wow, youre ignorant. Dont remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didnt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
19231,Done
19232,Have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
19233,Be careful what you wish for
19234,"Amazingly, the media is awesome vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll"
19235,My point exactly
19236,"Ahem, you have nano in your bio. That is % synonymous with bs."
19237,Reddit is great
19238,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
19239,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They dont realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
19240,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
19241,I did to any who asked
19242,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didnt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
19243,"Maybe after you get your Model , we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved"
19244,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March is about right."
19245,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
19246,Gasoline or diesel?
19247,What car do you drive?
19248,March
19249,The media
19250,"Hi Kara! Im open to it. Right now, Im cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
19251,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called Youre Right! I do actually own , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
19252,Definitely
19253,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these and this is the best one"
19254,Yo
19255,Thats the basic idea
19256,"For some reason, this is the best Ive felt in a while. Hope youre feeling good too"
19257,"I just tried to donate, but you dont accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
19258,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
19259,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious
19260,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
19261,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
19262,"If youre in media &amp; dont want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it"
19263,"Ive never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They havent forgotten UAW betrayed them. Thats why UAW cant even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
19264,Of course
19265,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but were doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company."
19266,"No, theyre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
19267,Will do
19268,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
19269,Thats why editors are included too
19270,We dont. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
19271,"Even if some of the public doesnt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves."
19272,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
19273,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
19274,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
19275,Exactly
19276,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda"
19277,An exception that proves the rule
19278,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
19279,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesnt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among worlds biggest advertisers."
19280,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
19281,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks hes above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
19282,"Thought youd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks Youre just like Trump! Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
19283,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
19284,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis &amp; Oblivion"
19285,I am not cool
19286,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
19287,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so Im glad theres some good too . Her music is incredible."
19288,Thanks. Not super fun right now
19289,Busted
19290,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
19291,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
19292,Great idea!
19293,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
19294,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
19295,Interesting he stops at . Thats when you drove GM &amp; Chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
19296,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. Its an off-menu item for those in the know
19297,"But ya know what, lets test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is /2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Lets hold a vote &amp; find out."
19298,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost + jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it."
19299,"Were going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; . What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
19300,Good point
19301,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of class lords &amp; commoners system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
19302,"More Reveal bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; theyve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article"
19303,No problem
19304,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
19305,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
19306,I didnt meet with him
19307,I definitely dont do this minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Cant be creative otherwise.
19308,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
19309,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasnt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
19310,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
19311,"To be clear, all Model cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Todays Model S is far more refined than initial production."
19312,ABS calibration algorithm
19313,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
19314,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla wont stop until Model has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
19315,"Stop, youre making me blush"
19316,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model Performance power output a little"
19317,Complexity is the devil. Words cant express how hard we are working on the Model production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But well try.
19318,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
19319,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time weve seen anything like this."
19320,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
19321,"Very strange. Model is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
19322,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didnt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar.com."
19323,Gwynnes awesome. Been SpaceX prez for years. Super love working with her.
19324,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
19325,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
19326,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as facts by Reveal."
19327,Were working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak &amp; pinpoint origin by acoustic signature &amp; triangulation
19328,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to Plum Brook vacuum chamber
19329,For sure before snowfall this year
19330,It can tow far more than rated capacity
19331,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
19332,"With production, st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need to months after k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live."
19333,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
19334,Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on whats happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
19335,"Yeah, Reveal was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as todays non-union."
19336,"About % of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
19337,Yes
19338,Exactly
19339,They can form a union whenever they want &amp; theres nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just dont want to.
19340,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. Its like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
19341,"They are correct. Its awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
19342,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you cant tell"
19343,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model in July.
19344,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about /week right now."
19345,Good idea ...
19346,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
19347,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
19348,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also miles. Takes -60mph to sec &amp; top speed to mph.
19349,Black &amp; white interior available only for Model Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
19350,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
19351,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but % quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
19352,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model : sec -60mph mph Top Speed mile Range"
19353,"Its only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
19354,Exactly
19355,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
19356,Im about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
19357,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
19358,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
19359,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior."
19360,"AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in."
19361,Working on Model dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
19362,Check out . Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
19363,But The Boring Company is right behind you at /15th your speed &amp; soon will be /10th! Start sweating
19364,He taunts us with his speed
19365,Just an ordinary snail
19366,His name is Gary &amp; hes a snail
19367,Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever
19368,Excited for partnership with LA Metro
19369,lol
19370,Listening to REALiTi
19371,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
19372,Yes
19373,Will be presenting &amp; taking questions about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at pm on Thursday
19374,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in to mins
19375,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
19376,"It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
19377,Whats actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
19378,"Its super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
19379,Yes
19380,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every M miles in (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every M miles. Its not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
19381,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx X better than avg."
19382,Happy Mothers Day Mom! Love you so much.
19383,"Fair criticism, but were fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
19384,Lovely story
19385,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I cant figure them out."
19386,"SpaceX will prob build to rocket cores for ~300 missions over years. Then BFR takes over &amp; Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars &amp; eventually outer planets."
19387,Good piece by Ars
19388,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
19389,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines quaint, but not something youd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general."
19390,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
19391,Yo
19392,Will make that a setting
19393,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, hours a day, days a week"
19394,No use arguing with chimp. Youre blocked.
19395,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass"
19396,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever
19397,Launching in ~4 mins
19398,"AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, thats when we *start* making them. Cant instantly fill all orders. Will take + months to do so."
19399,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange"
19400,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
19401,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
19402,A cool thing about the design is thats easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
19403,Already started DC to NY route. Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner.
19404,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final
19405,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country &amp; will be there in person for the launch."
19406,"This will work on entire S &amp; X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
19407,"All X &amp; S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high &amp; you enable feature"
19408,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
19409,!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.

19419,Hi Danielle!
19420,"Dont want to blow your mind, but Im pretty weird. Its time the world knew."
19421,Night at the museum. G has mad skillzsz. Me not so much.
19422,Literally every word is untrue
19423,"Thats a white rose on my jacket &amp; the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything"
19424,This chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels &amp; the artists only a small fraction of these numbers

19439,"Ok ok, just for sake of argument, what do u wish for in candy?"
19440,What do you think were living in?
19441,It just occurred to me that the plot of Willy Wonka is really messed up
19442,I am super super serious
19443,Im starting a candy company &amp; its going to be amazing
19444,This will be bigger
19445,I try so hard to help them
19446,Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
19447,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If youre short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit"
19448,New Roadster will have that
19449,"Yes, definitely not"
19450,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
19451,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
19452,Yup
19453,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
19454,"We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model , as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
19455,"Reason RBC question about Model demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching k/week production, it would take years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to ."
19456,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
19457,"The questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
19458,Exactly
19459,"First, its important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while"
19460,Please ignore this thread unless youre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
19461,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
19462,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model is about to do same."
19463,"To be clear, Im a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
19464,"The dry questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
19465,Youre most welcome
19466,Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is rd in world after a place &amp; mall. Giga will be largest when complete.

19482,Mostly not
19483,Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at locations in Puerto Rico. Team is working /7 to activate several hundred more.
19484,Russia has great rocket technology &amp; talent. Much respect. Would encourage focus on reusability. Single-use rockets cannot be competitive any more than single-use aircraft.
19485,Doing our best
19486,Now
19487,Driving a Model and playing
19488,"Yeah, exactly! Would be great to hear your thoughts. Were going to try a few approaches. Can def be done, just about minimizing mass."
19489,"We already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in Pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesnt become a dead satellite. Need to retarget closer to shore &amp; position catcher ship like Mr Steven."
19490,And then land on a bouncy house
19491,"Yeah, but great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all Mach regimes &amp; drops ballistic coefficient by orders of magnitude"

19494,Interview and Tesla factory tour with Gayle King
19495,Too wasted to remember
19496,"Dont want to brag or anything, but that happens to me sometimes"
19497,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
19498,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now its just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable &amp; cash flow+ in Q3 &amp; Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
19499,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is to months."
19500,Looking into it. This is bizarre.
19501,Maybe a little
19502,Gwynnes got it covered. Shes awesome.
19503,I love trolls
19504,Norway has some really cool tunnels and bridges

19510,Free viewing ends in about hours
19511,Definitely. Will take corrective action immediately. Sorry about this.
19512,Looking into it now
19513,Should just be due to your config not avail yet. If not lmk.
19514,Similar timing
19515,So probably July
19516,We need to achieve k/week with Model before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp
19517,"This is kinda nutty for such a short distance, so could easily end up being shredded metal, but exciting either way"
19518,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
19519,Model is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.
19520,The cat videos are awesome
19521,at M views after hours. Congrats to Chris Paine &amp; co!

19529,"Oh, its on"
19530,Most people dont know theres a whole box of Easter eggs with every Tesla. Just tap logo on center screen &amp; wait. Easy access to most of discovered ones. More coming
19531,"Uhh, hello, I need to build cars"
19532,"About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we dont design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so Im back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell"
19533,"Cant believe youre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on whats most critical, which is currently Model production. Doug, who I regard as one of the worlds most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
19534,"We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesnt matter."
19535,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. Im sure theres a really great answer"
19536,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
19537,"Seriously! Obviously, Im not going to do an April Fools joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
19538,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."
19539,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven"
19540,What about this?
19541,Elon University is a real place
19542,Coming soon to Tesla merch. Free shots in stores every April st.
19543,As you wish
19544,Its the best
19545,"Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model , surrounded by ""Teslaquilla"" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks. This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point? Happy New Month!"
19546,"There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter and a half (the worst one)."
19547,"Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April , -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."
19548,Important news in a few hours

19560,"Turns out joking about being a rock star because of digging tunnels (through, uh, rock hello??) is deeply underappreciated"
19561,"Yes, you can upgrade hardware, although we also wrote software to accelerate rendering on old MCU. Coming out soon &amp; makes a big diff."
19562,"From my Mom: every time I use irony, I lose a friend"
19563,And they said Id never be a rock star
19564,Yes

19569,"First kit set will be ancient Egypt pyramids, Sphinx, temple of Horus, etc"
19570,"New Boring Company merch coming soon. Lifesize LEGO-like interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to create sculptures &amp; buildings. Rated for California seismic loads, so super strong, but bored in the middle, like an aircraft wing spar, so not heavy."
19571,"New nav starts rolling out this weekend. Should be considered a mature beta at first, so wont be perfect, but will improve rapidly. With the old system, we were stuck with legacy rd party black box code and stale data. No way to improve."
19572,Shocker
19573,Its not a political statement and I didnt do this because someone dared me to do it. Just dont like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.
19574,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness &amp; safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
19575,Youll live
19576,Weve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
19577,"Instagrams probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I dont use FB &amp; never have, so dont think Im some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we dont advertise or pay for endorsements, so dont care."
19578,Ok
19579,"What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
19580,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
19581,Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
19582,First time Ive seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
19583,Maybe that word doesnt mean what I think it does
19584,Literally never seen it even once
19585,"Yeah, its borderline. FB influence is slowly creeping in."
19586,I didnt realize there was one. Will do.
19587,Inconceivable! Whod say a thing like that!?
19588,Whats Facebook?
19589,"Wow, a whole week. Risky ..."
19590,Umm...yes
19591,Yes
19592,I double-dare them to come back! Bring it ...
19593,No technology is too advanced for The Boring Company!
19594,"That said, Lori deserves a lot of credit for supporting competitive, commercial space launch while under massive assault from old-school monopolists"
19595,"No real surface is perfect, but it did pull about lbs of muck rail cars out of a tunnel"
19596,"Probably mid next year before we are able to make RHD. Wish it could be sooner. Maybe try a Model S, used or new in the meantime? Used S is better than a new imo, unless you want a smaller car."
19597,Sorry
19598,"Model X pulls a lb (15,000 above US road legal limit) semi truck on a pure snow surface"
19599,Thanks!
19600,Sounds like this canton has style!
19601,Ok
19602,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay. Only just got back from Gigafactory. Will be at our Fremont factory in the morning. Tesla team is going all out.
19603,Better to be in the Model X
19604,"The Swiss police are smart. Electricity vs diesel &amp; maintenance more than make up for purchase price diff. Plus, the bad guys will def not escape. Thats worth a lot"
19605,Maybe there should be providers for Chicago advanced transit. Monopolies are so boring ...
19606,Petra and Mars
19607,"Lori, this is ridiculous. Creating a rocket company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to make money. If it was about money, Id just do another Internet company."
19608,This is completely false. Never even heard of Cortica. Just taking my kids on a Spring Break trip to see ancient historical sites in Israel &amp; Jordan.

19625,Doesnt make any sense. You cant take things that fail &amp; make them work without creativity &amp; invention.
19626,"No, its not"
19627,None of the above
19628,Tunnels
19629,Because blue
19630,"I guess you could say its a mph, underground, autonomous, electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. So, yes, a bus."
19631,"Better video coming soon, but it would look a bit like this:"
19632,"Boring Co urban loop system would have s of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination &amp; blend seamlessly into the fabric of a city, rather than a small number of big stations like a subway"
19633,Definitely

19639,"To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing."
19640,"We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable."
19641,"I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. Its like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes."
19642,"Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even % of their own factory in China, but there are five % China-owned EV auto companies in the US"
19643,"For example, an American car going to China pays % import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays %, a tenfold difference"
19644,"Do you think the US &amp; China should have equal &amp; fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints &amp; other factors."

19652,"Very proud of the SpaceX team! Cant believe its been fifty Falcon launches already. Just ten years ago, we couldnt even reach orbit with little Falcon ."
19653,"Falcon flight launches tonight, carrying Hispasat for Spain. At metric tons and almost the size of a city bus, it will be the largest geostationary satellite weve ever flown."
19654,"Very sensible summary of supersonic flight. Obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag &amp; low boom amplitude at ground. If boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too."
19655,Good points. Will add to feature list.
19656,"Yeah, that should improve soon. Software team has been buried in Model bringup and tricky bug fixes, but thats mostly done now."
19657,Almost done

19660,"Want to clarify that as individuals, the people responsible for the high costs &amp; long timelines are almost all well-meaning, but the system of incentives is messed up"
19661,"Higher safety &amp; environmental requirements &amp; labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy &amp; a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost."

19684,"High altitude wind shear data shows a probable % load exceedance. Small, but better to be paranoid. Postponing launch to tomorrow, assuming winds are better then."
19685,"Todays Falcon launch carries SpaceX test satellites for global broadband. If successful, Starlink constellation will serve least served."
19686,Strange though. Delta IV Heavy has half the payload of Falcon Heavy and the BO rocket doesnt exist yet.
19687,I dont get the little ship thing. You cant show up at Mars in something the size of a rowboat. What if there are Martians? It would be so embarrassing.
19688,Im sure its parked around here somewhere

19690,My new toaster
19691,Adding software feature to open glovebox automatically when car comes to a stop after a crash. Will look at bonding a thin plastic sheet to the front or back of screen.
19692,Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block . SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
19693,Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
19694,"East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters"
19695,No
19696,A Shortfall of Gravitas
19697,A third is under construction
19698,"Under consideration. Weve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing , flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected."
19699,"Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."
19700,Of course
19701,"Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before"
19702,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after . Nutty high."
19703,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
19704,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

19735,Falcon Heavy launch simulation almost ready. Will be set to Bowies Life on Mars.
19736,Customs problem solved!
19737,Or maybe Temperature Enhancement Device
19738,"Apparently, some customs agencies are saying they wont allow shipment of anything called a Flamethrower. To solve this, we are renaming it Not a Flamethrower."
19739,"Early access build and especially Dev build are feature-rich, but the features arent reliable enough yet"
19740,Release candidate in final testing phase
19741,No
19742,I think weve figured it out
19743,Yes
19744,"Small detail, but each one will come with a serial number from to"
19745,A snowthrower would be really fun
19746,All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher
19747,Flamethrowers sold out
19748,Of course
19749,Yes
19750,"This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didnt hurt the droneship, but amazingly it has survived. We will try to tow it back to shore."
19751,"Woz is a lovable, fuzzy bear"
19752,From the worlds leading experts in zombie defense
19753,Now thats a real flamethrower

19757,So hard to keep future product releases secret
19758,k
19759,"For sure, and it keeps you warm at the same time"
19760,Coming soon
19761,Sure
19762,Sentience is overrated
19763,"But wait, theres more: the flamethrower is sentient, its safe word is cryptocurrency and it comes with a free blockchain"
19764,Ok
19765,Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
19766,Youd need millions of zombies for a so-called apocalypse anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
19767,The rumor that Im secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
19768,Good thing you didnt ask about the Freezegun ...
19769,Hmmm
19770,Unless you like fun
19771,"Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely dont buy one."
19772,"ordered already, only left!"
19773,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, youll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"
19774,Dont do this
19775,ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. Id be way more scared of a steak knife.
19776,Great for roasting nuts
19777,The Boring Company flamethrower guaranteed to liven up any party!
19778,Say hello to my little friend
19779,Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb from Apollo launchpad A at Cape Kennedy. Easy viewing from the public causeway.
19780,Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so.
19781,Check for updates
19782,Done
19783,"Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
19784,There arent even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
19785,"Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
19786,That sounds cool. Will do.
19787,Fixed in next release
19788,"Long exposure of rocket ascent, reentry from space and landing burn. (Credit )"
19789,Good idea. We can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.
19790,Of course. And an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history.
19791,Near
19792,"Gonna put an old school drive-in, roller skates &amp; rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in LA"
19793,Falcon Heavy goes vertical
19794,Using a neural net to detect rain using cameras (no dedicated rain or sun sensors). Computers are very patient.
19795,Come work at the biggest &amp; most advanced factory on Earth! Located by a river near the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains with wild horses roaming free.
19796,Coming very soon
19797,Vastly better maps/nav coming soon
19798,Ok
19799,Sure
19800,"Yeah, its terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized."
19801,Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature Id like to add.
19802,"Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model ramp."
19803,"Was gonna say well do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun"
19804,Should be in next update
19805,Done
19806,I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost years. Am dying to build it.
19807,"Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so its going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience."
19808,"Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. So much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that youd truly love. I hope you do. How can we improve further?"
19809,"We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks."
19810,The circle is complete
19811,Ok
19812,"Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!"
19813,It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail
19814,True
19815,"So strange that people often believe things inversely proportionate to the evidence. Given a set of possible explanations, why pick the extremely unlikely one!?"
19816,Yes
19817,Having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens
19818,"When you get the new Tesla software update, go Ho Ho Ho. Theres an Easter egg inside the Easter egg, but its not funny."
19819,"k limited edition boring hats sold, K to go. Then flamethrower."
19820,I think last night might have been the biggest Rorschach test ever
19821,Isnt it obvious?
19822,"If you liked tonights launch, you will really like Falcon Heavy next month: rocket cores &amp; X thrust. cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. rd lands on droneship."
19823,Never heard of it
19824,Nuclear alien UFO from North Korea
19825,It was definitely aliens

19827,"His PhD is in literature (really), presumably bad fiction"
19828,How much is it?
19829,I love Twitter
19830,"Bloody hell, Im going to have to write a blog. Cant fit this into tweets."
19831,I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
19832,"However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
19833,"Major navigation overhaul coming in early . Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
19834,"For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
19835,"Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but arent (having PhD in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. Thats what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit expert."
19836,Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon.
19837,Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.
19838,Pics soon
19839,"With people around, so you can see scale"
19840,"If things go perfectly, all three rocket booster cores will come back and land. Sides back at the Cape, center on the droneship."
19841,Falcon Heavy launching from same pad as the Saturn V Apollo moon rocket. It was % higher thrust with five F-1 engines at M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.
19842,Max thrust at lift-off is million pounds or metric tons. First mission will run at %.
19843,Hate it when that happens. Some people are so rude!
19844,Falcon Heavy at the Cape
19845,Knight Rider is real
19846,Thanks!
19847,"For now, we only use those on super hot reentry missions. Will go to all Ti with Falcon V5, which is a few months away."

19851,k
19852,Meant to say sanctimonious idiot
19853,Good point. Its just a really bad and fundamentally misleading article that doesnt actually represent my point of view at all. Other publications referred to it as an interview.
19854,Sorry
19855,Youre an idiot
19856,"This depressingly misleading &amp; misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an AI conf, not from an interview with Wired as is falsely implied. This is why I stopped following Wired long ago. There are way better tech pubs out there."
19857,Yes
19858,"Yeah, pretty much anywhere"
19859,Yes
19860,"hat aficionados, in appreciation for their exquisite taste in millinery, will be picked at random to tour the LA tunnel &amp; drive boring machine"
19861,Our existence cannot just be about solving one miserable problem after another. There need to be reasons to live.
19862,It is high time that humanity went beyond Earth. Should have a moon base by now and sent astronauts to Mars. The future needs to inspire.
19863,"And those are just the really big ones. The Permian was especially bad, unless you were a mushroom."
19864,Safest flamethrower ever
19865,"I know its a little off-brand, but kids love it"
19866,"After k hats, we will start selling The Boring Company flamethrower"

19869,"On Tuesday, SpaceX will attempt to refly both an orbital rocket and spacecraft for the first"
19870,Yes
19871,Do it
19872,The *real* money comes from merchandising. I learned it from this documentary
19873,Deal
19874,"That special hat delivery will take place deep within the real, but fictional (of course), tunnel we are building under LA while you drive the giant machine blindfolded. This will actually happen."
19875,Beyond anything you can imagine
19876,"And, at the risk of stating the obvious, extremely boring"
19877,Because its stupid
19878,Maybe

19884,Thats certainly the right way to go to store massive amounts of data for a long time
19885,Asimovs Foundation books should def be part of the mission. Theyre amazing.
19886,I love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future
19887,Red car for a red planet
19888,Yeah
19889,Yes
19890,Payload will be my midnight cherry Tesla Roadster playing Space Oddity. Destination is Mars orbit. Will be in deep space for a billion years or so if it doesnt blow up on ascent.
19891,"Falcon Heavy to launch next month from Apollo pad at the Cape. Will have double thrust of next largest rocket. Guaranteed to be exciting, one way or another."

19913,Good point
19914,"For one thing, aliens obv built the pyramids! Who but aliens could have figured out how to align and stack stone blocks in a series of concentric squares!? Um, ok, I guess maybe people."
19915,"Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities."
19916,Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.

19980,Answers: Yes. No. Doesn't matter.
19981,"There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is ""What color?"". Don't need a configurator for that."
19982,"Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference."
19983,"Dec will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now"
19984,Yeah
19985,"I'm doing my best to recalibrate, but that is a fair criticism. However, if I wasn't inherently optimistic, I wouldn't be doing electric cars and rockets in the first place!"

19993,Not good. Sounds like some rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action
19994,The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
19995,"Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums."
19996,"Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today"
19997,"I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."

20003,"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR."

20030,"Absolutely. Moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time."
20031,Does my hivemind count as me?
20032,Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters.
20033,In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.

20055,"Not a bad idea. For sure, it makes sense to test AI for safety in some kind of open world / sandbox virtual world."
20056,In about six months or so. Linked to dual motor config.
20057,We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it
20058,Tunnels are sealed to atmospheres of water &amp; gas pressure. Just need walls around the apertures.
20059,"Not sure, but probably"
20060,Feature coming soon
20061,"They're so real. Anyone going to that much trouble must really care. I'd gladly follow their commands, but they're so friggin obtuse"
20062,That's pretty much why we did it
20063,"Worth reading Life by . AI will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity, so lets get it right."
20064,Hyperloop (near) vacuum tube runs parallel to SpaceX on Jack Northrop Blvd. It is miles long and just under ft in diameter.
20065,"To be clear, a Hyperloop passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect (just for testing), nor uncomfortable acceleration"
20066,Brakes
20067,Will run the SpaceX pusher sled later this week and see what it can do
20068,"Moon base alpha (cheesy show, but I loved it) plus Mars"
20069,"Not that this is remotely equiv to man on the moon, but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it"
20070,"Actually, no, his architecture was different. Also, thinking of going to the moon and actually going to the moon are not the same thing."
20071,Hyperloop pod run by team WARR
20072,"The AI could def find us there, but maybe it won't care"
20073,A Model S in The Boring Company tunnel being dug under Los Angeles (starting in Hawthorne)
20074,"Yes, it is"
20075,A tiny one
20076,"Btw, high accel only needed because tube is short. For passenger transport, this can be spread over + miles, so no spilt drinks."
20077,"No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"
20078,Call it ~800mph
20079,"Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only miles long. Very high accel/decel needed"
20080,"Congratulations to WARR team from Tech Univ Munich for winning nd competition! Peak speed of km/h, which is over mph!!"
20081,Just arrived at the competition final. Student teams have amazing talent!
20082,I hope they and any others trying to advance transport technology succeed
20083,"Exactly. Wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of SpaceX and Tesla, as the probability of failure was &gt;90%."
20084,"Sorry! Coming next year, along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US, Mexico and Central America."
20085,"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
20086,Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
20087,I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
20088,"The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."
20089,"From last year, but still my favorite video of the Falcon rocket booster returning from space"
20090,SpaceX and The Boring Company are running the Hyperloop competition
20091,"Tesla does not really have ""TTunes"". That's a joke."
20092,"Will be hanging with my little chum, Gary, on Sunday"
20093,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here:
20094,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
20095,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
20096,Neuralink is not raising money
20097,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
20098,"Max velocity: Mach Max altitude: km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
20099,Probably m or so
20100,Exactly. Yeah.
20101,Intentionally? Yes
20102,It is approximately the size of a carrot
20103,Touchdown: Vertical Velocity (m/s): Lateral Velocity (m/s): Tilt (deg): Lateral position: m from target center
20104,Falcon boost stage on droneship Just Read the Instructions
20105,"A midnight amendment, followed by a vigorously opposed subpoena. Someone has been naughty"
20106,I played those games
20107,"That's a SpaceX engineer in there, not me"
20108,New Model X SUV now faster than a $500k Lamborghini
20109,"Yeah. It's kinda disgusting, but my boys and I love it"
20110,First picture of SpaceX spacesuit. More in days to follow. Worth noting that this actually works
20111,"I would say that is the greatest publication in the history of all conscious beings, living or dead"
20112,"I'm not the CEO of Ball Mason Jars. Also, not judging"
20113,Was at a friend's party this weekend and drank wine from a mason jar
20114,I can't hide the truth any more
20115,Yes
20116,Watching eclipse with sunglasses on through the Model S glass roof. Wow!
20117,SpaceX rocket factory as seen from space
20118,"Yeah, but not a priority right now"
20119,I'm not coming for anything. Just digging some tunnels and might draw a vacuum on some of them.
20120,"We are going to move all info and settings to the ""cloud"" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you"
20121,Pics of SpaceX spacesuit developed for NASA commercial crew program coming out next week. Undergoing ocean landing mobility/safety tests.
20122,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
20123,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
20124,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
20125,Will prob do something like that
20126,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
20127,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
20128,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
20129,Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.
20130,I love Kermit
20131,"But you can check it out on . Btw, this isn't a video, like cliff diving or fake rocket landings, that matters if it's reversed."
20132,Wigs me out too much. Deleting ...
20133,"Yes, just that the permitting process is slow"
20134,I want one too!
20135,"Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!"
20136,"The danger is def high for South Korea, due to proximity, but much less for distant targets like the US. SK anti-missile tech is excellent."
20137,"We certainly could, but, while not suggesting complacency, I'm confident that the US DoD and intelligence orgs have this covered"
20138,th mission of our Dragon robotic space freighter in support of the
20139,First draft animation of the Falcon Heavy three core launch. FH is twice the thrust of the next
20140,For sure
20141,Biggest impediment to recognizing AI danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't
20142,Would like to express our appreciation to Microsoft for use of their Azure cloud computing platform. This required massive processing power.
20143,OpenAI + Dota
20144,It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
20145,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."
20146,"I sure hope so, but we can't take that for granted"
20147,"If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea."
20148,OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess &amp; Go.
20149,Coming soon ...
20150,Hi Mom!
20151,A level orc illusionist and dressmaker
20152,This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least seconds checking your facts.
20153,Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
20154,There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter &amp; maybe to that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
20155,"One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either."
20156,"MB was given weeks of salary &amp; stock in appreciation for her great contribution &amp; left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist"
20157,"Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist"
20158,"Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
20159,"Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors &amp; never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so"
20160,Major increases in the Supercharger and Tesla urban charger network happening over the next several months
20161,First draft animation of the Falcon Heavy three core launch. FH is twice the thrust of the next
20162,I agree. Working on it ...
20163,It's only a matter of time
20164,y
20165,"True, although the changemyview subreddit is least likely to be clicked on by people who really should change their view"
20166,"Arguments, followed, of course, by complaints"
20167,Are you complaining that we are not complaining enough?
20168,And let's not forget the forum on which we are posting I've heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on Twitter.
20169,Like I said ...
20170,It gets really dark
20171,"True, there are frequent complaint expansion packs"
20172,Except for complaining. That has remained constant throughout history at /100.
20173,Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed km on a single charge! Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!
20174,I guess a proof of concept is needed
20175,Looking forward to launching astronauts to the International Space Station next year!
20176,Sorry about that. You certainly should have been. Will get you guys in a car right away.
20177,"No, must brake safely to a halt"
20178,SpaceX student Hyperloop top speed competition coming up soon!
20179,We poured our heart into the car. Hope you love it.
20180,Sure hope so
20181,Batteries!
20182,"Thoughtful Model review by , one of the most insightful journalists"
20183,"There are several dozen ship names in the Culture series, but I liked those best"
20184,Umm ...
20185,"Yeah, it's better than a Model . We can put a lot more in a car at a higher price."
20186,"I'm sure there are better answers than what I do, which is just take the pain and make sure you really care about what you're doing"
20187,"If you buy a ticket to hell, it isn't fair to blame hell ..."
20188,"Maybe not medically tho. Dunno. Bad feelings correlate to bad events, so maybe real problem is getting carried away in what I sign up for."
20189,Yeah
20190,"The reality is great highs, terrible lows and unrelenting stress. Don't think people want to hear about the last two."
20191,Model uses two intersecting planes of air for vertical control &amp; lateral fins hidden within the dashboard for horizontal control
20192,Model Interior
20193,Yes
20194,Probably middle of next year. Focus now is on getting out of Model production hell. More versions = deeper in hell.
20195,Yes
20196,Sure
20197,"Watched them personally to make sure &amp; I agree with the outcome. Wouldn't have judged differently. Amazing videos all, but was best."
20198,Couldn't believe how incredibly inspiring and creative they were!!
20199,First!
20200,Second
20201,Third
20202,Project Loveday winners ...
20203,Setting up for Model handover tomorrow night ...
20204,If we're lucky
20205,"Sides run high thrust, center is lower thrust until sides separate &amp; fly back. Center then throttles up, keeps burning &amp; lands on droneship."
20206,Side booster rockets return to Cape Canaveral. Center lands on droneship.
20207,Falcon Heavy maiden launch this November
20208,Tesla team will verify
20209,Testing The Boring Company car elevator
20210,Love this Tesla P100D drag racing video
20211,Movie on the subject coming soon...
20212,"Tim's piece on AI is excellent, but we actually face a double exponential rate of improvement. AI hardware &amp; software are both exponential."
20213,I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.
20214,A book of the most beautiful classic cars given to me on my th birthday on a farm in Saskatchewan. Van Gogh's Starry Night.
20215,$US price in $AUD plus import duties and sales tax
20216,We can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public co. Will check if possible through a feeder fund though.
20217,Often comes as a surprise when people learn that % of my time is on engineering/design and just % on other stuff
20218,A m diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories ...
20219,"Yes, I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket &amp; spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day."
20220,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.
20221,Kinda have to
20222,LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries &amp; motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
20223,"Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state &amp; city discussions."
20224,Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
20225,"An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
20226,City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
20227,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
20228,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
20229,For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
20230,Support would be much appreciated!
20231,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
20232,Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in mins.
20233,"Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship"
20234,y
20235,"True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels &amp; confused shorts."
20236,Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
20237,Not true. Email from customer.
20238,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past &amp; present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly"
20239,"Yeah, otherwise hard to find them"
20240,y
20241,"It is true, so fine by me"
20242,"Small thing (very small), but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same."
20243,It's what you don't say
20244,I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
20245,Good point
20246,Fixed. Now it's good.
20247,Yes
20248,Stay tuned
20249,I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow
20250,"Excited to announce the launch of ! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
20251,Just checked and yes
20252,"True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon . Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
20253,Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.
20254,US Senate hearing on advancing the exploration and settlement of space
20255,"We do that too, but for free"
20256,Hopefully
20257,"Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes, buying single use airplanes wd seem crazy."
20258,That doesn't sound right
20259,"Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed (""Other US"" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not."
20260,Latest S and X tires have internal acoustic foam
20261,Going over the small nuances of Model production. Very important that nothing sounds tinny.
20262,Cool!
20263,"The very near future, not, like, the far away future"
20264,"You can now drive anywhere in the US (except N Alaska), most of Europe, China &amp; Japan using the Tesla Supercharger network!"
20265,Of course!
20266,"On University Ave, above the old bakery"
20267,"One of my sons is named Xavier, after Professor X!"
20268,That's probably the best use
20269,Cool
20270,Maybe the upcoming IAC in Adelaide
20271,"It was a tough negotiation, but they seemed like good guys. I hope they kept the stock. Would be worth a lot today."
20272,"That pizza looked about as appetizing as drywall. If anything, they were doing people at the party a favor by taking it."
20273,"Wasn't wearing a suit, am def not part of a ""posse"" &amp; didn't even know Leo/Orlando were going. Just went to say hi to my friend Ken Howery."
20274,"Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back ! No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me."
20275,First Production Model
20276,"It's who is first to pay full price for the car. Hard rule. I have first Roadster and X, but not first S."
20277,"Ira Ehrenpreis had rights to st car as he was st to place a full deposit, but gave those rights to me as my th bday present. Tks Ira!"
20278,Production unit of Model is now built and going through final checkout. Pics soon.
20279,Never heard of them
20280,Stop biting my finger dammit
20281,This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of . Australia rocks!!
20282,"The world's population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care"
20283,"Thanks ! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was km, Falcon achieved km."
20284,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
20285,We're going to spend the th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than th/6th. Only one chance to get it right
20286,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
20287,Looks like we can reach Model cars per month in Dec
20288,"Handover party for first customer Model 's on the th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be cars and Sept above ."
20289,Model passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
20290,Norway is awesome
20291,"Actually, China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things, that's where iPhones, many Android phones &amp; most laptops are made."
20292,Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good
20293,Coming later today
20294,Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed &amp; built it.
20295,Suggestions welcome!
20296,I think Einstein said that
20297,Or does the Earth move up?
20298,This is a really great floor
20299,Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.
20300,Across the road and below the ground
20301,Perspective
20302,"Nothing to be done, but wait. It's all right here:"
20303,News on Sunday
20304,Because it's off the wall
20305,Maybe it is time for the man cape to return
20306,Didn't read it. Might now though.
20307,Exactly
20308,Me too
20309,"Yes, but arguably that's worse"
20310,And I don't care who knows it. Our love will never die.
20311,Just try one. It's way better than you think.
20312,A floor that moves
20313,A ceiling is simply a floor from below
20314,Not as much as tunnels though
20315,They are so underappreciated
20316,They will never let you down
20317,I love floors
20318,Gary (the snail) is a speed demon. Long way to go before we beat him/her.
20319,"Thanks, but I am"
20320,No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
20321,"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long."
20322,"Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack &amp; peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach reentry is X Mach . Intense."
20323,They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
20324,Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it
20325,More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
20326,"Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours."
20327,Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
20328,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
20329,Still humans
20330,Significantly improves control force
20331,Launch at :25 delivering satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.
20332,"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry."
20333,"We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about years ago"
20334,"Not only that, it has all the wifis and G is coming soon"
20335,Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
20336,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
20337,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon to land in heavier winds."
20338,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
20339,"Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"
20340,Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.
20341,Sticking to
20342,"It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace"
20343,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
20344,Falcon will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
20345,"Technically, Ironyman"
20346,Thanks! Looks cool.
20347,"Damn, I forgot bacon"
20348,"In life, there are no easy choices"
20349,Do want irony on social media?
20350,Must remember that irony and social media are not friends. Keep forgetting. Dammit.
20351,Radiation
20352,Groan
20353,"But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise"
20354,Will extend
20355,Over km should be possible in a D with the right tires
20356,Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts &amp; radiative view factor is low.
20357,"No plans to change kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model pack is about cost reduction, not performance."
20358,No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer
20359,Cool
20360,"That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention"
20361,"First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot"
20362,Calling this cueless would be generous. Much less energy required for lithium-ion batteries &amp; Gigafactory is powered by renewables anyway.
20363,No plans to change cell form factor for X and S
20364,"This is crazy, but Max Smart mentions Chaos towards the end. Coincidence?"
20365,There's a plot!?
20366,ujelly?
20367,"My real phone is an HTC Droid, which I ordered after seeing this ad"
20368,Nothing beats the shoe phone that is also a real shoe
20369,But then I get paid less
20370,"Backup valve shows no sign of leaking, but yeah"
20371,If schedule holds there will be two Falcon launches within hours (Cape &amp; Vandenberg) this weekend
20372,"Postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic valve. It is dual redundant, but not worth taking a chance."
20373,"Promising conversations with regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes &amp; pedestrians. Permits harder than technology."
20374,It's time they knew
20375,Tesla service rescues a kitten stuck in the bumper
20376,So soon you won't believe it
20377,Colonizing Mars (thanks Prof Hubbard for creating this from my talk). Major changes to the plan coming soon.
20378,"Hawthorne, California"
20379,Flying through the Falcon Factory

20381,Radar-only braking on HW1 is getting better with every release. We're hoping to do the demo where it brakes for a UFO in the fog soon.

20390,"We are developing the interplanetary rocket and spaceship to allow anyone to travel to the moon, Mars &amp; beyond, regardless of nationality"
20391,Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
20392,Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
20393,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
20394,"I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama Prob worth doing?"
20395,Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only % of parts ended up being common.
20396,"Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."
20397,"The faster, the better. Gravity losses."
20398,Damn Stonecutters!
20399,"Was no ""company"", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize ACP's Tzero car. No tech or IP, no employees &amp; didn't even own Tesla Motors name."
20400,"Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation."
20401,Exactly
20402,Congrats Robb!

20409,"Long way to go, but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs &amp; gave them all our patents to help, so that's something"
20410,"Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought % prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance."
20411,"Since big car companies were killing their EV programs, the only chance was to create an EV company, even tho it was almost certain to fail"
20412,"They was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars"
20413,Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in &amp; then crushed them in a junkyard

20437,"It's on the car. Might add it to the Tesla app at some point, so you get it on your phone if you have a Powerwall or Tesla solar."

20466,"I'm not *saying* they're related, but"
20467,Or is it more about the way you use it?
20468,I hope I'm wrong
20469,"Probably closer to to imo. would be a linear extrapolation, but progress is exponential."
20470,Great comedy! They should write for .
20471,Most likely
20472,"Also, we will have a very high headcount around each Gigafactory keeping it running. They just won't be doing boring, repetitive tasks."
20473,Probably closer to four or five factories. Logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end customer.

20478,"Most people don't realize you can see Dragon approach the Space Station from the ground, even in LA"
20479,Proud of my Mom
20480,"Yeah, pretty much dead center. We painted the target area with radio reflective paint, which helps the radar be more precise."
20481,Exactly
20482,It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars &amp; airplanes and how it should be for rockets.
20483,First reflight of a Dragon spacecraft set for later today
20484,Good point
20485,India commits to sell only electric cars by . It is already the largest market for solar power.
20486,"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by as the US does from all sources today"
20487,Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
20488,Coming soon
20489,Yeah
20490,Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case
20491,"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp; via councils, that we remain"
20492,And then some
20493,"Yeah, it was great!"

20501,Comparing Model S vs Model
20502,Old-school fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks
20503,There will be a combined booster static fire. Maybe a few.
20504,"Btw, that cloud is almost entirely steam, including dark parts (like a storm). This is what the launch looks like:"
20505,"Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ..."
20506,Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to people.
20507,Only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain
20508,You are right. Going at max speed. Not much time left.
20509,Busted
20510,Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.
20511,True
20512,Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me
20513,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
20514,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
20515,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
20516,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
20517,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
20518,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety"
20519,Exactly
20520,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
20521,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
20522,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
20523,Hopefully June for those too
20524,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
20525,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version ). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a ."
20526,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that % of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
20527,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
20528,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
20529,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
20530,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
20531,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off"
20532,Something cool for sure
20533,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
20534,"Model , Model X &amp; Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision &amp; control software."
20535,Wear underpants
20536,Will do
20537,Black and textured slate versions will be
20538,Yes
20539,"For reason I can't explain, I find especially odd. Also, not a fan of . Has led too many people astray in valuing securities."

20568,Third one will be from Frost. Maybe the second.
20569,Yes. Good.
20570,"First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where."
20571,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems &amp; plays. Decided against plays &amp; poems. Too obvious.
20572,That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
20573,This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.
20574,Slo-mo hail cannonball impacting Tesla solar roof tile

20576,Yes

20640,Working on it
20641,Looks like it could do % more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
20642,A lot

20657,No
20658,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...
20659,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
20660,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
20661,Yes
20662,Yes
20663,I believe so
20664,Yup
20665,Oh so little faith
20666,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a kWh pack in Model at current cell/module energy densities
20667,Yeah
20668,Start taking orders in April
20669,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
20670,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles"
20671,The Model S produced today is arguably version . Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model arrives.
20672,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
20673,No problem
20674,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."

20678,First drive of a release candidate version of Model
20679,It still has one display
20680,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
20681,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
20682,How about the video we just took of the first Model release candidate drive?
20683,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
20684,I think so
20685,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
20686,Tues/Wed
20687,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
20688,Tues/Wed next week
20689,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
20690,"Yes, but not until next year"
20691,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
20692,"Sorta. Model is like a BMW series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW and series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
20693,How about now?
20694,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
20695,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
20696,Definitely
20697,"Model was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different"
20698,Yes
20699,"Model is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
20700,"Am noticing that many people think Model is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone vs . This is not true."
20701,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
20702,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
20703,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
20704,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.

20726,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC."
20727,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.
20728,"Just spoke with , Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
20729,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
20730,$250/kWh at the pack level for MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
20731,Tesla will get the system installed and working days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
20732,Will send you one
20733,Self-hatred
20734,Thanks JJ!
20735,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!
20736,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.
20737,"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it or times ever."
20738,Fly me to the moon ... Ok
20739,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at pm PST
20740,of course
20741,maybe one of those too
20742,Roller coasters are awesome
20743,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
20744,Good chance it will
20745,Exactly
20746,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
20747,Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
20748,Excellent Tesla Model X review
20749,Just posted a video
20750,Baby came back
20751,no
20752,System was green for launch. I called it off.
20753,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp risk on Dragon , that I feel very confident of ."
20754,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
20755,"Btw, % likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that % chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
20756,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
20757,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
20758,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
20759,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast
20760,spacex's photo
20761,"Provided Dragon demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in"
20762,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
20763,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow."
20764,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
20765,It's much easier to do the CGI that way
20766,Daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.
20767,I used that one
20768,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
20769,They are doing India proud
20770,You may come to regret that request
20771,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
20772,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
20773,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
20774,"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
20775,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
20776,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited."
20777,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
20778,Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
20779,Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
20780,Falcon rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex -A. This is the same launch
20781,Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
20782,"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
20783,of course it will
20784,Should all be uploaded by next month
20785,Motor Trend could only achieve sec when they tested the Porsche
20786,I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
20787,George Schultz and Jim Baker article in regarding a carbon tax
20788,yes
20789,Hoping for summer this year
20790,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
20791,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit ."
20792,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
20793,"No plans to take X, S (or ) above kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
20794,Take out the floor mats and its . MT said everything had to be standard production.
20795,yes
20796,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to mph in sec
20797,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
20798,No rare earth metals in battery
20799,Almost ready
20800,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
20801,"Yes, but Model is the overwhelming priority"
20802,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
20803,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
20804,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
20805,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in chars and tone is lost in text"
20806,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
20807,Rolling out a new update today.
20808,We should try our best
20809,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
20810,I just had three coffees
20811,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
20812,Numeric
20813,Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
20814,"I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota."
20815,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
20816,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
20817,True. Me being one of them
20818,"Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but th out of + countries with only a diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
20819,"Fair point, sorry"
20820,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
20821,Exactly
20822,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
20823,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
20824,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
20825,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool"
20826,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
20827,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
20828,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
20829,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
20830,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
20831,Mostly anti-drug laws
20832,Exactly
20833,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
20834,The remedy for that is changing the law
20835,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
20836,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
20837,True!
20838,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
20839,Walking down the street and saw this
20840,I wish!
20841,"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
20842,"Wow, cool!"
20843,That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
20844,Nuances are important
20845,ft diameter tunnel running miles under D.C.
20846,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
20847,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
20848,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council &amp; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
20849,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"
20850,First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
20851,maybe
20852,Video of MIT's entrant into the SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Air has been removed from the Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.
20853,Minecraft
20854,"Yes. Green cards &amp; dual citizens already ok. Work &amp; spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action."
20855,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
20856,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
20857,yes
20858,Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
20859,"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
20860,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI
20861,"I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting"
20862,"Yeah, sorry about that"
20863,"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"
20864,Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material
20865,Strategic &amp; Policy Forum
20866,"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
20867,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus &amp; present to President.
20868,It is not
20869,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong &amp; don't deserve to be rejected."
20870,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the countrys challenges
20871,"This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true."
20872,And we start digging the tunnel tonight
20873,Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
20874,"Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people &amp; it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution &amp; hope good comes of it."
20875,"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway."
20876,"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the Freeway, which is mins from LAX"
20877,Yup
20878,Maybe next month
20879,Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.
20880,Rex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle.
20881,I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
20882,No they don't
20883,Was wondering what those were
20884,Sigh
20885,That may be a difficult award to decline
20886,"Tillerson also said that the risk of climate change does exist and he believed action should be taken"""
20887,"... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."""
20888,"Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: ""I think its important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ..."
20889,"Ok, fine. Soldier . My dark secret is out ..."
20890,I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
20891,"Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA."
20892,"This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State."
20893,There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
20894,"months maybe, months definitely"
20895,"Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present"
20896,"Auto steer limited to mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data."
20897,Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every to weeks
20898,For now
20899,"The D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted"
20900,Yes. Block is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
20901,"If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically"
20902,Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every to months.
20903,Yes
20904,"Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing + parts. Wish there was an easy way."
20905,Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China!
20906,Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon .
20907,"Car won't complete camera calibration. Working on software solution to adjust image crop dynamically, so camera more robust to pitch angle."
20908,Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
20909,Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
20910,"Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory"
20911,Our target is a % reduction with HW2 as the software matures
20912,"Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot"
20913,It might. Am not sure.
20914,Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
20915,Report highlight: The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost percent after Autosteer installation.
20916,Final report on Autopilot issued by is very positive
20917,One million
20918,Falcon before launch
20919,Not the ideal ending
20920,There will be many improvements to HW1 over the course of the year
20921,Yes

20923,"Rewatched ""Ghost in the Shell"" and the end of ""Colossus: The Forbin Project"""
20924,"HW2 Autopilot now downloading to all HW2 cars, but in non-actuating mode to assess reliability. If looks good, actuation by end of week."
20925,Rotates degrees and does a retro burn
20926,It does
20927,Liftoff
20928,All satellites deployed
20929,Mission looks good. Started deploying the Iridium satellites. Rocket is stable on the droneship.
20930,Have you tried steam engines? They are amazing.
20931,Sarah should be in contact with you soon about doing a benchmark test
20932,It is
20933,"Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful."
20934,"Good point. would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as ."
20935,It will
20936,Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like to mph in sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
20937,"If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week"
20938,The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
20939,It will in an upcoming release later this year
20940,Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar &amp; sonar.
20941,Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
20942,"Longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in."
20943,"If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial"
20944,New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first &amp; to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
20945,That was a great game
20946,via
20947,Hold-down firing of Falcon at Vandenberg Air Force completed. All systems are go for launch next week.
20948,HW2 Autopilot software uploading to cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.
20949,"Late Jan, along with Linux kernel upgrade"
20950,"Yes, but held up by Autopilot . It def works tho in shaving sec off -60mph &amp; /4 mile. If AP goes tmrw, then perf upgrade goes Thurs."
20951,"Resolving an Autopilot HW2 bug that shows up when booting from a subzero cold-soak. If that fix works, software will start uploading tmrw."
20952,Churchill (non) quotes
20953,Almost there. Undergoing final validation. Might go out in next few days.
20954,Deus ex machina on the center screen when it ends
20955,Occasional existential dread is inevitable if you think at all about the future
20956,"Yes, grid won't be needed for moderate use Superchargers in non-snowy regions"
20957,"A mere kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?"
20958,Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
20959,"There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place."
20960,"If you don't like the P100DL, you can give it back"
20961,Good idea
20962,Yes
20963,"Should complete in . One is def planned for Swift Current, near my cousin's wheat farm where I had my th bday."
20964,"It is keyed off the volume of music in the car. If you turn that down w left scroll wheel, it will be quieter."
20965,Typing Mars after holding down the T symbol on the center console works on S and X. Also try renaming your car .
20966,"Make sure your car is connected to wifi for the update. Will update over its cell connection too, but takes much longer."
20967,"To activate the Model X holiday performance, just type holidays or ModelXmas after pressing the logo. Also, Mars."
20968,Looking promising for next week
20969,"No major precipitating event, but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads"
20970,"Some years away, but yes"
20971,"Will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle, ie you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign"
20972,Night is easy. Twilight is hardest.
20973,That is actually rolling out to all Model X's right now
20974,Yes
20975,", which hopefully goes out next week."
20976,Hoping for next week. Also going through validation.
20977,Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week
20978,Tesla receives highest owner satisfaction score of any carmaker in Consumer Reports survey
20979,Tesla Autopilot vision neural net now working well. Just need to get a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of environments.
20980,In work
20981,Tesla software team is working seven days a week to complete testing and validation. Getting close.
20982,Should start changing soon
20983,I am actually going to do this
20984,"We are going to modify this so that people only pay a fee if most bays are occupied. If the site is basically deserted, no problem to park."
20985,"Boring, it's what we do"
20986,"It shall be called ""The Boring Company"""
20987,Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...
20988,You too
20989,"You're right, this is becoming an issue. Supercharger spots are meant for charging, not parking. Will take action."
20990,Forming a rocket nozzle
20991,A life well lived
20992,"How do we know this story isn't fake? Unfortunately, it is probably true."
20993,Model S smashes into semi truck trailer and lifts it off the ground. Driver walks away.
20994,about three weeks and it will get rolled out incrementally in monthly releases
20995,yes
20996,at least some of them
20997,That doesn't make sense. Will look into it.
20998,About weeks
20999,Backlog of seat foldflat config. seat can be made earlier. Actually my fav version.
21000,Love the pic tho
21001,Can anyone uncover who is really writing these fake pieces? Can't be skankhunt42. His work is better than this.
21002,perfect

21007,Consequences of population implosion greatly underestimated. Upside down demographic pyramid can't support social services.
21008,big mobile app update coming with next month
21009,Vote tally shows ~85% of unaffiliated shareholders in favor of the Tesla/SolarCity merger! Thanks for believing.
21010,sounds right
21011,"All P100D vehicles produced to date, as well as new. This is purely a software optimization."
21012,Model X numbers should also improve by sec on to and /4 mile
21013,Looks like the Model S P100D Easter egg will allow it to do to mph in sec and a sec /4 mile via software update next month
21014,"Wow, thanks. We won't let you down."
21015,"we could enable that, although the cameras use grey, grey, grey, red detection, so it would look a little greyish red"
21016,Love you too!
21017,"a bit like that, but hopefully a more meaningful role for humans"
21018,Playing Amish Paradise in my Tesla
21019,"Both UV and IR (for heat) reflective. I burn easily &amp; then my nose looks like Rudolph the reindeer, so I totally understand."

21021,I like humanity
21022,there will be something special
21023,"Tesla will def absorb SolarCity debt. Altho extremely unlikely, I would pay it personally if need be. Debts must be honored."
21024,My kids and I are having a great time!
21025,next software update fixes that
21026,might have an early access release ready by then
21027,now wouldn't that be interesting
21028,Here is how to vote your Tesla and SolarCity shares:
21029,hmmm
21030,one day ...
21031,it is not actually left-handed
21032,unless we do a deployable solar shield like a retractable hard top
21033,currently cycles radio favs. Next software release cycles between favs.
21034,Forgot to mention there will be a P100D Ludicrous Easter egg soon that uncorks the full performance
21035,no
21036,use buttons on left side of steering wheel
21037,Thanks!

21052,There would def be millions of agents simultaneously doing a Monte Carlo sim &amp; combining the results to build a map of weaknesses
21053,good chance
21054,Only a matter of time before advanced AI is used to do this. Internet is particularly susceptible to a gradient descent algo.
21055,yes
21056,yes
21057,strongly net positive
21058,"Solar glass tiles can also incorporate heating elements, like rear defroster on a car, to clear roof of snow and keep generating energy"
21059,yes
21060,"Should mention that the Tesla solar roof is robust against any weather, incl heavy hail. Also, higher insulating value than a standard roof."

21381,"Of greater concern: of suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
21382,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter

21411,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
21412,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
21413,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
21414,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
21415,Satellite deployed to km apogee. All looks good.
21416,mins to launch
21417,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
21418,Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
21419,"Flight is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
21420,Great image of ancient Mars
21421,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
21422,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
21423,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
21424,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
21425,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
21426,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
21427,Full height of Falcon boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
21428,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon , but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
21429,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
21430,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
21431,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
21432,yes
21433,yup
21434,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
21435,Three's company
21436,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
21437,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.
21438,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
21439,tambin te amo
21440,It's probably the Ambien
21441,Definitely
21442,Ok
21443,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
21444,coming soon
21445,Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
21446,I think so
21447,Max is just X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
21448,I love you too!
21449,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to km above Earth"
21450,Thank goodness all are ok
21451,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
21452,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
21453,Woohoo!!
21454,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
21455,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model soon if you want delivery"
21456,yes
21457,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
21458,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
21459,"Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
21460,Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
21461,next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
21462,exactly
21463,"sides def, center maybe"
21464,naturally
21465,Falcon Heavy thrust will be M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
21466,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to M lbf later this year. It is capable of M lbf in flight.
21467,F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be kg
21468,"No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
21469,No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
21470,Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract % to % for reusable booster payload.
21471,"Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce sigma reserve margin."
21472,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon and Heavy
21473,yes
21474,turns out it doesn't need securing
21475,yes
21476,"yes, several times"
21477,for sure
21478,things like this should be purged shortly
21479,+ for almost everything + for heat shields and a few other items.
21480,Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
21481,"JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
21482,System scan detected only % of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
21483,of course
21484,Temporary spike in some areas due to X rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
21485,"Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are , so speculation unlikely."
21486,Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
21487,checking into it ...
21488,will definitely do so
21489,"some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
21490,"It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
21491,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
21492,Dragon is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
21493,"A should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
21494,That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
21495,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well
21496,"Aiming for relaunch in to months, pending detailed examination and X refiring of a returned booster"
21497,We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
21498,By land and sea
21499,Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.
21500,Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck
21501,Godot Full play
21502,"Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where."
21503,me too!
21504,Great video history of Falcon by Kinematic
21505,needs latest update
21506,"Activate autopilot X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon."
21507,"Not from us, but it's awesome"
21508,"Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not"
21509,Thanks
21510,yes
21511,"Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think."
21512,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you."
21513,Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
21514,Thanks!
21515,Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
21516,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
21517,"Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none."
21518,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet
21519,Nickel is also in nickels
21520,"Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic."
21521,"Over k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only % ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation."
21522,the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
21523,"yes, will go all the way to Alaska"
21524,"Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter."
21525,we will
21526,Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
21527,We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
21528,Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche Turbo S to a Model X
21529,Model X review
21530,probably unwise
21531,"won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height"
21532,yes
21533,yes
21534,yes
21535,yes
21536,sounds good
21537,"Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells."
21538,Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
21539,"yes, coming this year"
21540,Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
21541,you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for .
21542,correct
21543,hopefully
21544,what's the link to that?
21545,"No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
21546,no problem
21547,Will cover whole country hopefully this year
21548,"yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
21549,less
21550,torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
21551,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
21552,"Model will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
21553,yes
21554,Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
21555,definitely
21556,should be addressed this year
21557,Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
21558,that's not the real steering system
21559,yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
21560,Some tweaking underway
21561,Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the . It feels like a spaceship.
21562,Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
21563,Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
21564,They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
21565,It will make sense after part of the Model unveil
21566,"A Model order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
21567,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
21568,We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
21569,There will be an optional tow hitch.
21570,Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
21571,Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
21572,"cool, thanks!"
21573,"Yes, if the trend continues, before"
21574,k Model orders by end of Sat
21575,Model design sketches
21576,"We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before production starts."
21577,They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
21578,"Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for . They deserve a lot of credit."
21579,"we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
21580,"yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
21581,and a few other things
21582,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe -30 people per store would line up, not . Gifts on order."
21583,Maybe /4 to /2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part of the unveil.
21584,"Will give an update tonight for the day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."
21585,k as of am this morning
21586,thanks!
21587,Now k orders
21588,of course
21589,"Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night."
21590,def on the cards for the future
21591,should be within a week or two max
21592,"Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car."
21593,Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
21594,"Thought it would slow way down today, but Model order count is now at k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly."
21595,"Model orders at in hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!"
21596,Will include India-wide Supercharger network
21597,sure!
21598,Coming in the mail
21599,Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
21600,Just order the SpaceX option package!
21601,"Thanks for tuning in to the Model unveil Part ! Part is super next level, but that's for later"
21602,"yes, will cover whole country"
21603,yes
21604,sure is
21605,X and S will also be available
21606,"Adding several more countries to Model order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland."
21607,"Model orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person"
21608,Online ordering at will now open at :30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at :30.
21609,From almost anywhere
21610,Coming soon!
21611,"Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model . You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up."
21612,Model unveil will be webcast live at :30pm California time at
21613,"You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve."
21614,"Tomorrow is Part of the Model unveil. Part , which takes things to another level, will be closer to production."
21615,Model order day starting in Australia
21616,You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing.
21617,Great article by . Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most
21618,Looks like we may need to increase production plans for the Model
21619,Tesla charger map
21620,being fixed
21621,sure
21622,"Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window."
21623,no
21624,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
21625,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was years away from achieving this.
21626,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
21627,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
21628,Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
21629,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
21630,Target altitude of km achieved. Thanks for riding on Falcon ! Looking forward to future missions.
21631,We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
21632,. SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign
21633,Evolution hasn't advanced much
21634,MIT Technology Review
21635,checking ...
21636,exactly
21637,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
21638,Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
21639,Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
21640,AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
21641,"Great leg room for rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
21642,"yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
21643,"Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick seats unless you really need ."
21644,"That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
21645,Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
21646,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.
21647,Next gen Atlas robot
21648,coming later this year
21649,"There is no way it is only %, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as %."
21650,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or % for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
21651,Just wanted to thank Stu G for . Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
21652,Don't you already have a spaceship?
21653,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs
21654,Sigh
21655,Hi
21656,"yeah, that's a great one too"
21657,Little bit
21658,"Worth watching ""Nathan for You"" on Comedy Central, particularly the ""Dumb Starbucks"" and ""Mechanic/Realtor"" episodes"
21659,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning
21660,yes
21661,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
21662,"yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
21663,This baby Model S really is quite fun
21664,More details on Model unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
21665,yes
21666,No signature series for Model . Same reservation amount for all.
21667,global
21668,Model reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March and online April
21669,good point
21670,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
21671,Love this Tesla video made by
21672,My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret
21673,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
21674,Interesting name
21675,I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
21676,"My best guess for : ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in"
21677,Thanks Jeff
21678,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it"
21679,"Stage would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
21680,"Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
21681,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
21682,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
21683,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
21684,steel collet
21685,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
21686,probably
21687,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
21688,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
21689,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
21690,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine showed thrust fluctuations."
21691,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
21692,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions
21693,Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
21694,"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
21695,"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."
21696,First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1
21697,"Worth reading The Machine Stops, an old story by E. M. Forster"
21698,"Falcon back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found, ready to fire again."
21699,High res video of landing from the helo
21700,Live video from LZ-1
21701,Falcon standing on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
21702,thanks!
21703,There and back again
21704,Thanks Jon!
21705,"satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
21706,Background on the launch
21707,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
21708,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
21709,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
21710,Meant to reply to this article:
21711,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
21712,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
21713,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
21714,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
21715,About mins from static fire
21716,holding for issue resolution
21717,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
21718,mins from static fire test
21719,"yes, from F to F"
21720,It worked in Texas
21721,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
21722,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
21723,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
21724,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
21725,Announcing formation of
21726,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
21727,Agreed. Working on it.
21728,wow
21729,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
21730,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
21731,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
21732,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
21733,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
21734,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
21735,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
21736,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
21737,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
21738,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
21739,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
21740,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
21741,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
21742,Yeah and hell yeah
21743,From anywhere
21744,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
21745,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
21746,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
21747,definitely aliens!
21748,Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
21749,well done!
21750,noted
21751,"Wow, that's great!"
21752,Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves sec -60 mph and sec /4 mile in Motor Trend test

22384,"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
22385,"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money"
22386,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
22387,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
22388,The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.

22961,Probability at % &amp; rising rapidly due to new architecture
22962,Congratulations
22963,Coming soon
22964,Yes
22965,Got it
22966,"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico."
22967,Yep
22968,Yes
22969,"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to % of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey."
22970,"Most people dont know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China"
22971,We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
22972,Ok
22973,Wow!
22974,"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
22975,"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:"
22976,"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because its electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
22977,"There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc"
22978,Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in days! Order online at to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
22979,Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!!
22980,"No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ..."
22981,"Thanks, hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent."
22982,Sigh
22983,Yes
22984,"Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side"
22985,Glad youre ok!
22986,Starship will look like liquid silver
22987,Haha
22988,Maybe
22989,Much less
22990,Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.
22991,"Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better"
22992,"Yes, signal acquired from that dish"
22993,Stainless Steel Starship
22994,Which seems to be the approximate pixel size of reality
22995,When its no longer noticeable over Plancks length
22996,Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earths gravitational reach is infinite. Zero gravity is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.
22997,At SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas
22998,Amazing space progress by China. This year they did more orbital launches than the USA for the first time.
22999,Engineering is true magic
23000,Yezzz
23001,How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
23002,Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities
23003,Please put invented car fart on my gravestone. This is my only request.
23004,Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
23005,"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."
23006,Thanks!
23007,"Its embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
23008,You def dont want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need horsepower per engine. Thats not a typo.
23009,"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to bar. That is a mad level."
23010,Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
23011,"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
23012,"Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word star or link"
23013,"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars."
23014,Coldformed at cryo
23015,"This test hopper is at full body diameter of m / ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter."
23016,Were building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
23017,Exactly
23018,"For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry."
23019,Yes
23020,"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle were building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
23021,"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; were using a different alloy mix. I super Series Stainless!"
23022,"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
23023,"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
23024,"If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
23025,Coming soon
23026,"It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model orders delivered by year end"
23027,Try connecting to WiFi
23028,"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer cant take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in days. Order online at or visit stores."
23029,Only if Dawkins joins
23030,Interesting
23031,Bajirao Mastani
23032,"Anxiety is a scalar, fear is a vector"
23033,Yes
23034,Haha
23035,Namaste
23036,Needs a warmup
23037,Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every minutes! Hope you have a Merry Christmas!
23038,"Thanks, will consider next year"
23039,"So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this wont matter for the first few layers"
23040,Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in mins with a few taps. No more need to call!
23041,"As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a after them haha"
23042,"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that built a ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally X better, should be operational next year. For reference:"
23043,Join our underground movement!
23044,"Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out"
23045,Ok
23046,Autopilot doesnt need the guide wheels. Theyre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
23047,Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?
23048,Exactly
23049,"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
23050,"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
23051,"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
23052,"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think theyre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
23053,"Youre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didnt include it. Were working on one that makes things clear."
23054,"Pop up, park and walk!"
23055,I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding rd St.
23056,"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy"
23057,"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety."
23058,Next step for Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is vehicles/hour at mph (250km/h).
23059,Precisely
23060,Presentation starting at :15
23061,"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
23062,"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start"
23063,"Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but its time to upgrade to something better."
23064,All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
23065,"Capable of traveling safely at over mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
23066,Yes
23067,"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"
23068,Tesla in tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again
23069,Boring product launch will be streamed live at pm California time tonight
23070,Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport
23071,Same applies to those who didnt order PUP
23072,Exactly. Its a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development!
23073,"Yeah, I wrote that back in , almost years ago!"
23074,"Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers &amp; cell phones. It takes many design iterations &amp; vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability."
23075,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
23076,Totally false. Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiels Founders Fund: we have no concerns whatsoever.
23077,"Same facts, same period of time, but extremely different reporting"
23078,Tis
23079,Medieval Futurism
23080,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
23081,Thanks!
23082,The white seats are actually extremely stain resistant. You can spill red wine on the seats &amp; just wipe it off.
23083,Congratulations!
23084,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in weeks, even if you havent placed an order yet"
23085,You got it
23086,Pretty good. I have confirmation turned off on my engineering build &amp; interventions are rare. Probably ready to enable no confirmation setting next month.
23087,Zero Suit
23088,God Fire
23089,ramen is sooo good
23090,Exactly
23091,This part is true. I was trying to explain that we dont want our cars to have a tinny sound.
23092,You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
23093,Seems likely that well be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though
23094,"Incorrect. Chairman is an honorific, not executive role, which means its not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in years. Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut provided I have the support of shareholders."
23095,About to days
23096,"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get days to return for full refund vs day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
23097,"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla cant deliver your car this year."
23098,No need to wait. Its super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
23099,Im dying to make a pickup truck so bad we might have a prototype to unveil next year
23100,Yes
23101,"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they dont believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they dont need to be."
23102,Probably next month
23103,Youre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story.
23104,"Were opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
23105,Probably end of next year
23106,So true
23107,This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
23108,"Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
23109,We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
23110,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over X the image processing ability."
23111,"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
23112,"If you have a Tesla built in past years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps."
23113,Machete!!
23114,"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had % of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
23115,"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car -2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldnt exist or would have started much later."
23116,"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China."
23117,"Buying took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didnt like even when we were only making ."
23118,"Tesla history trivia: we didnt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late . Hed originally filed for it in . Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
23119,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
23120,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
23121,Yes
23122,Interesting
23123,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
23124,The new design is metal
23125,"As far as we know, its the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesnt need heat shielding or even paint."
23126,Boring Company product launch on Dec . More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
23127,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
23128,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon."
23129,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
23130,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
23131,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
23132,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
23133,Falcon/Dragon launch to in minutes
23134,Us too sigh
23135,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
23136,satellites on this flight!
23137,"Were adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
23138,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if theres no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
23139,It is so hard to move in armor!
23140,Youre all hired!
23141,Yes no maybe
23142,None shall pass!
23143,Ok
23144,Good advice
23145,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. Were also working on vision-only driving.
23146,Glad youre ok
23147,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
23148,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly % range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
23149,"Incoming rocket &amp; fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
23150,You got it!
23151,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
23152,No
23153,No
23154,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Cant wipe it off."
23155,Haha
23156,"Prof Dahn is correct (hes great), but the relative benefit is small. Id recommend % more SoC for convenience."
23157,"Not worth going below % imo. Even % is still fine. Also, no issue going to % or lower SoC."
23158,True
23159,Both
23160,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
23161,One day
23162,"Were doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but were just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
23163,Update soon
23164,Sorry
23165,Boring breakthrough
23166,Definitely
23167,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
23168,We tried. Nintendo wont license it to us.
23169,That would be cool
23170,Haha kinda true
23171,Never heard of it
23172,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games."
23173,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
23174,Yes
23175,"This is completely backwards. Based on what weve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, were moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Wont need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
23176,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
23177,Tiny wizard
23178,to years
23179,"Engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
23180,Touch
23181,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesnt feel like work"
23182,"Varies per person, but about sustained, peaking above at times. Pain level increases exponentially above ."
23183,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on hours a week"
23184,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then , , &amp; are the places to be."
23185,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
23186,liters of pure water costs $1
23187,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
23188,Ah yes fair point
23189,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
23190,Not yet
23191,trouble
23192,Earth is
23193,"Earths crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava"
23194,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is % water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as its all land. Even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about /3 land."
23195,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
23196,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks &amp; heatshield"
23197,"If you dont want a Tesla, heres a list of all electric cars in North America via"
23198,Signing off for a while
23199,Happy Thanksgiving!!
23200,Starships were meant to fly
23201,Starship Tooters
23202,Good one
23203,Good idea
23204,Coming soon
23205,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
23206,Should be next week
23207,"No, its the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon"
23208,Later versions will
23209,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earths deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
23210,Renaming BFR to Starship
23211,"No, were just going to accelerate BFR"
23212,Yes
23213,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
23214,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of % to % of population in all active markets.
23215,"No, its got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about % to % of effort, all things considered."
23216,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
23217,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
23218,"Lot on our plate, so its either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
23219,Ok
23220,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. Thats a great van. We will inquire.
23221,Absolutely agree
23222,Investigating
23223,Probably mid
23224,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
23225,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
23226,Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response.
23227,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
23228,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
23229,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
23230,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
23231,Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isnt needed
23232,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with or taps
23233,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive."
23234,Radical change
23235,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
23236,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
23237,"Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to in Model for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
23238,Congratulations on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
23239,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!
23240,Missed miku concert sigh
23241,Listening to Better Now
23242,"China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation &amp; transport"
23243,"Sure hope this isnt true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict."
23244,Haha
23245,Looking back at the sun from upper stage &amp; Falcon landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
23246,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for min bulk discount.
23247,While (!castle) {brick++};
23248,Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
23249,Fortnite irl
23250,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
23251,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
23252,Not much but it is ours
23253,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent
23254,"We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains dont leave often."
23255,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
23256,Yes
23257,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
23258,We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
23259,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
23260,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, its better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
23261,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model can be delivered in US by Dec if ordered by Nov
23262,We will fight Big Tequila!
23263,That would be awesome
23264,Easily accessible energy
23265,Send me a note!
23266,Would be fun to add to Tesla
23267,Yes
23268,Will try again next month
23269,"Congratulations team! Thanks , much appreciated."
23270,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever."
23271,Is he ok?
23272,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler."
23273,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
23274,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
23275,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for grant money. They earn vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
23276,"That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
23277,"We know well run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far"
23278,Because people on the ground know more about whats actually needed than politicians do
23279,"Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model ."
23280,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
23281,"Fair point, will reenable"
23282,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
23283,Please lmk what youd most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
23284,Cool
23285,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
23286,Yes
23287,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
23288,"No, were building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
23289,Wont land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we cant test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
23290,Aiming for orbital flight by June

23304,"Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent"
23305,"Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating &amp; decelerating"
23306,So underappreciated
23307,Ok
23308,Ok
23309,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec . Will be very one-dimensional.
23310,"Sounds like pure luxury! When I said sponge, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with trillion siblings."
23311,What is love?
23312,Bikini Bottom
23313,Fair
23314,"Yes, that is how"
23315,We didnt even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
23316,Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
23317,Wow thats cool!
23318,Kids these days have it easy
23319,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
23320,Haha
23321,First movie I ever saw in theaters
23322,When the only existing life was a sponge
23323,Although it was in the precambrian era
23324,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.
23325,Theyre great! Honored to work with them.
23326,Yes
23327,Definitely
23328,"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
23329,"Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in"
23330,"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
23331,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
23332,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
23333,"Amazing results by at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
23334,Prob to weeks
23335,v true

23342,"Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway"
23343,We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
23344,Hahaha &lt;ahem&gt;
23345,Um yes
23346,"Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon &amp; say whos the pet now"
23347,"Also, youll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"

23350,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM
23351,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm its valid &amp; park."
23352,Cool haha
23353,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer &amp; secretary. Guess I have to keep st one or it will confuse the authorities."
23354,"Good point, might put that one back"
23355,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. Im now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
23356,Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
23357,"Dont worry, well make it right"
23358,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Cant wait.
23359,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
23360,"Its a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action"
23361,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of production hell sounds like a sure thing!?"
23362,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
23363,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
23364,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
23365,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
23366,Didnt you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers dont get that.
23367,Exactly. Thats Monday.
23368,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
23369,"No, but I will"
23370,Isnt it obvious?
23371,Worth it
23372,True
23373,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
23374,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
23375,Haha
23376,"On Insta, % of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get %."
23377,Lacks scale
23378,"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
23379,"Reddits twitter account is lame, because its not real Reddit"
23380,Exactly
23381,Youre right. Earlier Model Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
23382,"On Twitter, likes are rare &amp; criticism is brutal. So hardcore. Its great."
23383,Glad youre ok
23384,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model , so bikes can fit in trunk"
23385,Hey thats my Halloween costume!
23386,Good question
23387,"Clearly, youre not reading my twitter"
23388,I wish

23410,Send me ur dankest memes!!
23411,in
23412,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
23413,Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
23414,"Model was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model was product alone."
23415,Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldnt be here without you.
23416,Same
23417,Howd they know!?
23418,Around mid
23419,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
23420,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
23421,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldnt look like a radiator grill opening.
23422,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that theres no such thing as a Tesla refresh. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
23423,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov . Order now to be sure of the one you want."
23424,"Model body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
23425,Working on it
23426,That is correct

23441,"Pretty close, actually"
23442,I think real
23443,Opens Dec
23444,The first tunnel is almost done
23445,N00B!

23452,Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time?
23453,BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. Its time people knew.
23454,"No, bored me, I will not"
23455,Maybe phone as controller
23456,Exactly
23457,Coming
23458,Yes
23459,Reality is hard
23460,Online doesnt count
23461,Coming soon
23462,No
23463,Thats next
23464,Had to been done ur welcome
23465,I hope this is true!
23466,"If you dont like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
23467,Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
23468,"Model long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
23469,"Its kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
23470,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just dont use sport/summer tires."
23471,"Its a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
23472,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model &amp; super simple new order page"
23473,Week or two
23474,Love the Reddit comments too

23476,y
23477,Youll see
23478,Tomorrow brings a lemur
23479,Special Circumstances
23480,Yes
23481,New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
23482,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
23483,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
23484,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
23485,Just reviewed Teslas service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within to months.
23486,Insightful article by David
23487,"Thanks John, really admire you too! I think youre one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
23488,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
23489,I believe its $5k
23490,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
23491,Somewhere between % &amp; %
23492,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."
23493,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
23494,Still a long way to go
23495,Model motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.
23496,Works best if you play games full screen &amp; use steering wheel scroller balls for control
23497,Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now
23498,What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start.
23499,Yes

23510,"Wow, mechanical logic gates"
23511,Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
23512,Maybe wise to bring it just in case
23513,About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth &amp; half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens &amp; we destroy ourselves
23514,You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Dont have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
23515,Yes
23516,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."
23517,Visual approximation
23518,Teslaquila coming soon
23519,Glad youre safe
23520,Beautiful picture
23521,"Yes, its hard to find. Not sure why."
23522,"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSAs *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
23523,This is incorrect
23524,At Falcon LZ-1 Vandenberg on Sunday night with the Base Commander. Support of much appreciated.

23526,Punctuality is not my strong suit
23527,Wed be nothing without our fans
23528,Because is obviously louder than
23529,No such thing as a full refresh at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
23530,It sure does. Very reliable.
23531,You are right
23532,A reminder of why its important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power

23546,"Actually, its of forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. External cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked."
23547,Fair point
23548,"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to % of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as theyre just passive managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
23549,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide."
23550,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
23551,Only if theyre extremely tiny
23552,We dont judge. Any pic you want!

23556,The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
23557,"The big funds can &amp; will, as theyre suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for passive index tracking."
23558,"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder"
23559,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, dont realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
23560,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
23561,I hope to be less wrong over time
23562,Youre most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
23563,What they do should be illegal
23564,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
23565,Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
23566,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model actually outsold Camry by a factor of two"
23567,This is amazing
23568,Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to more users a few days ago.
23569,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
23570,"If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
23571,"Hang in there. If you are truly long-term, it will be fine."
23572,True
23573,Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? Its what they do.
23574,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
23575,Great verdict
23576,Could be worse
23577,"Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar &amp; side repeater camera neural nets just right."

23579,Naughty by Nature
23580,Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
23581,Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
23582,That was intense
23583,i
23584,!! Will take action.
23585,And remember
23586,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
23587,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
23588,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
23589,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay!
23590,What would be great is original Elite
23591,Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
23592,Tesla Owners
23593,"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
23594,"Apologies, were upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
23595,Tricky one
23596,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners whod like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
23597,Probably for a base to be built
23598,Mars Base Alpha
23599,"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
23600,"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have % on front, % on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
23601,Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at
23602,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."
23603,A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
23604,"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
23605,"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
23606,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
23607,"Exactly, all star are *not* the same, as the videos show. star just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
23608,Haha true
23609,. will post final safety probability stats soon. Model has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
23610,"Wow, glad theyre ok!"
23611,Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
23612,Tesla Rangers!
23613,"engines, but with room to add more down the road. Kinda have to."
23614,"Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldnt spend computing power on sound"
23615,Yes
23616,True
23617,"To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed"
23618,Youre most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
23619,Will do. Love Reddit.
23620,Space Bar
23621,"Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions &amp; anyone will be able to go"

23636,Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
23637,Thank you for your trust in the team. Greatly appreciated.
23638,Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
23639,Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. Its not sustainable long-term.
23640,Very interesting
23641,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night"

23656,"Sorry, its not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesnt incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
23657,Yes
23658,"Yeah, thats our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
23659,"Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting s of makes &amp; models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
23660,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
23661,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
23662,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"

23785,Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that its contingent on a shareholder vote.
23786,Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother &amp; less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
23787,"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every months or so (like SpaceX)"
23788,No change
23789,Shareholders could either to sell at or hold shares &amp; go private
23790,Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
23791,My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if were private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelitys SpaceX investment.
23792,Yes
23793,I dont have a controlling vote now &amp; wouldnt expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I wont be selling in either scenario.

23878,"Wow, thats really awesome. Thank you!"
23879,Haha
23880,"Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard."
23881,Only costs that actually apply to Q3 &amp; beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.
23882,Wall Street
23883,Congratulations to all teams in the student competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!

23895,For sure
23896,"Btw, is calling &amp; wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
23897,"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime &amp; save lives of many birds."
23898,No kidding
23899,"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
23900,"Phew . Yeah, we had a drain block months ago &amp; people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
23901,I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
23902,"Figuratively, literally or both?"
23903,That has always been our goal
23904,"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. Other US refers to Boeing &amp; Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts &amp; subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
23905,"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over S/X and Model *new* net orders."
23906,Definitely. We gave up some grip &amp; width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires &amp; wider on rear for best performance. You might get sec -60 mph or better with optimized rims &amp; tires.
23907,"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"
23908,I wish
23909,"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."

23911,Good point
23912,I have never donated to a SuperPAC
23913,"Yes, about % of what I donated to , which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
23914,Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
23915,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.
23916,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
23917,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
23918,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate. Doesnt mean Im moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me &amp; I dont understand why they are not important to everyone."

23957,Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
23958,Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isnt. Wonder why.
23959,"Damn, now I want donuts"
23960,Yeah
23961,Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
23962,"Youre right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but theyve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."
23963,Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
23964,"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint.com, but Im in China so that wont be working until tomorrow."
23965,Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
23966,Great move
23967,Why sir
23968,Stockholm: its not just a syndrome
23969,Good point
23970,"Definitely. Cant wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
23971,"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
23972,Well it looked smaller on paper
23973,"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big"
23974,"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
23975,It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
23976,Makes a lot of sense
23977,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now its there for anyone who needs it in future. Somethings messed up if this is not a good thing.
23978,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
23979,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
23980,Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
23981,Please lmk results of your water tests
23982,"When youre there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
23983,Should be very soon. Weve already made around Model Performance cars for test drives in stores.
23984,Exactly
23985,"No, it means I created jobs for people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"
23986,Already have
23987,"Ironically, the billionaire label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasnt called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
23988,"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time."
23989,"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
23990,"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time."
23991,"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as rescue chief) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:"
23992,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
23993,Ok
23994,Just returned from Cave . Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
23995,That would be cool. I wonder what its like under all that ice.
23996,A second one that is cm shorter is almost complete
23997,Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
23998,"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
23999,Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
24000,"Thanks, but weve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
24001,"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
24002,Tube diameter is cm
24003,"Mini-sub arriving in about hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
24004,Thanks for letting us use your pool
24005,It is an honor to work with them
24006,"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
24007,I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz
24008,It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
24009,"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
24010,"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player."
24011,"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
24012,Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. Theyre prevented from sliding off by the diver handhold attachments.
24013,"Testing for more hours in LA, then its on a plane to Thailand"
24014,"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to X cave water pressure."
24015,I am an engineer
24016,Tight control code is always C
24017,Python is done right. Great name story too.
24018,"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"
24019,Python
24020,Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
24021,Turbo
24022,C
24023,"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we couldve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."
24024,"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
24025,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.
24026,Yes
24027,Yes
24028,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
24029,Yes
24030,"handles/hitch points on front &amp; on rear. air tank connections on front &amp; on rear, allowing to tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
24031,Im in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
24032,"Construction complete in about hours, then hour flight to Thailand"
24033,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
24034,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
24035,Ground winds would
24036,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. Its a beast.
24037,Cant be too buoyant
24038,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
24039,Good idea
24040,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack."
24041,Youre welcome. Happy birthday!
24042,"Yeah, thats what Im talking about in that tweet double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
24043,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
24044,Its open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
24045,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
24046,I would def recommend this
24047,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
24048,Interesting
24049,"Great, thanks"
24050,Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
24051,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water wont come in"
24052,"Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
24053,SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
24054,"Looks like st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. nd &amp; rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
24055,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob X to X more power."
24056,Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
24057,"Walking speed is around km/h, but if youre in an air tube, time doesnt matter much. If tube diameter was m, a fast walk of km would take mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
24058,Maybe worth trying: insert a m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the cm hole.
24059,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
24060,"I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
24061,I didnt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots dont work for me. They just dont like hypocrites.
24062,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I dont use Facebook.
24063,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was dancing her face off with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?
24064,Why did publish a love letter puff piece about Chanoss cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective
24065,. posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption Love both these dudes. Doesnt sound very objective
24066,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
24067,Are you % certain that stands by &amp; supports everything shes done? Why wont Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
24068,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
24069,True
24070,"So publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Teslas most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is one of the greatest. Her articles print Chanoss view verbatim. This is not journalism."
24071,". You stated publicly that you see eye to eye with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
24072,What a coincidence
24073,Am not attacking all media or even all of . Just asked if you inform public about an analysts prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
24074,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: , did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
24075,"Exactly. , I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
24076,"Strange. , is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analysts track record before hearing their opinion."
24077,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself."
24078,"Sounds very sketchy if true. , is it possible youre serving as an inside trading source for one of Teslas biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
24079,"has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
24080,"Wow, so of wrote article that misled public about Model production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work &amp; ."
24081,"., why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
24082,". is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie /week. Tesla built S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."
24083,Happy to support
24084,"Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar &amp; is pretty good at digging holes. Dont know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps."

24158,Important to read the Wash Post article. The unable to account for number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a day period.
24159,Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
24160,True
24161,"We should always be concerned about the welfare of children &amp; those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan &amp; often inaccurate"
24162,"of the children, remained where they were placed, had moved, had run away and five were deported. That left migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHSs phone calls after days does not mean the children are missing"
24163,"All children were resettled by HHS. After days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in cases, the parents or guardians did not respond"

24251,Will do. Am enquiring on many channels. Regards to Scott.
24252,Do you know anyone who has gone there?
24253,Where are they?
24254,Where are you going to march?
24255,That seems unlikely

24259,I think so
24260,I hope the kids are ok
24261,Shelter
24262,Youre probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down.
24263,Im at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. Its big.
24264,They look beautiful
24265,Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
24266,Its actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
24267,Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
24268,They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And its way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
24269,No
24270,"Needed another general assembly line to reach k/week Model production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much"
24271,"Youre welcome, bad fiction writer"
24272,"Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW cant even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer."
24273,Your union brothers
24274,You wont find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
24275,"Thanks, good advice"
24276,They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
24277,Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software Im driving.
24278,Cant wait for the new season to start!
24279,"Weve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via rd parties."
24280,Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
24281,"Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show."
24282,"I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America."
24283,They started it &amp; attacked me personally
24284,Search UAW and corruption. Very long reading list. Great organization.
24285,Profit just means you earned more money than you spent &amp; certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla years &amp; were almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt.
24286,They dont seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
24287,Engels wrote nd &amp; rd volumes based on Marxs notes. Less reliable.
24288,"Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware."
24289,"Wow, you know nothing &amp; are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldnt care less."

24293,"Youre just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said Id fail &amp; be back in months."
24294,"I dont want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past."
24295,You think all companies are bad and all unions good? Thats a very bigoted position.
24296,Well said
24297,Then youll be fine
24298,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
24299,"...which clearly doesnt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of whats happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so theyre getting desperate."
24300,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
24301,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
24302,How big is your short position? Just curious.
24303,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guys claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
24304,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in . Tesla can only hire % of applicants, so must be doing something right."
24305,"UAW doesnt have % of signatures (about people) needed for a vote. They cant even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, theyre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
24306,"Im not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company cant compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Dont want Tesla to die too."
24307,"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
24308,"Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
24309,"Iain certainly wasnt pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldnt be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but thats a special case."
24310,"SX &amp; soon SX . Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine."
24311,"Structures, engines, avionics, guidance &amp; control software, new alloys, space lasers (ooh, maybe I shouldnt have said that)"
24312,Love you too
24313,Fair point
24314,"Auto-semiotic asphyxiation (sorry, couldnt resist)"
24315,And I dont trust that Engels guy. He could have made up most of nd &amp; rd volumes. Nobody actually knows.

24326,"If you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks"
24327,I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies
24328,"If Im not a communist, why do I make red cars"
24329,"Very appealing if youre a sophomore in college. Its a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness."
24330,That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
24331,lol
24332,"Read Das Kapital when I was , incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good."
24333,Might actually be his!
24334,Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of st Model dual motor performance coming off the line
24335,Youre a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.
24336,Yes
24337,Sigh
24338,"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."
24339,No sense of humor is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Answer: Thats not funny!!

24342,"Heading back into the factory, so thats enough for now. Dont take my Tweet too seriously. For one thing, its called a Tweet."
24343,No
24344,My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother &amp; I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
24345,"There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation."
24346,Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict peoples freedom.
24347,Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
24348,Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.

24351,What is yours?
24352,What is your utopia?
24353,The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape &amp; size of those streams.
24354,Strongly disagree. I love humanity.

24359,"Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon"
24360,Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. Its pretty simple &amp; mostly influenced by Douglas Adams &amp; Isaac Asimov.
24361,My donations are anonymous
24362,Already sold &gt;$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about years when Tesla is steady state.
24363,"My pay is in options, which only matter if stock goes up &amp; I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education &amp; environment on Earth w my foundation. Just dont want us to be sad about the future."

24366,"Yes, interface will change with Version software"
24367,"Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean slight up or downward force on the wheel, not really hold the wheel"
24368,"Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly."
24369,"Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered:"
24370,That is actual footage
24371,Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
24372,Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
24373,"Of course, but its the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; were never going to make them again."
24374,"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a seater instead of a +2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
24375,"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. Its what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust literally bulletproof."
24376,Not recommended for urban environments
24377,Yes
24378,"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what Im thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
24379,It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
24380,Love this design. Simpler the better.
24381,Add an R for Roadster
24382,"Sigh. This is crux of matter: cant make system too annoying or people wont use it, negatively affecting safety, but also cant allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
24383,A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model production reaches k/week steady.
24384,"Yes. Hopefully, Im not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
24385,Will do
24386,"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but theres no escaping Newtons Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
24387,"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we dont think there will be another."
24388,"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
24389,"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the halo crown effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
24390,"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version . To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
24391,"This is why Im not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then Id know everythings fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh"
24392,"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
24393,years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
24394,"In early s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That companys name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
24395,"Thats quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In , we open-sourced all Tesla patents"
24396,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps."
24397,"More background: I arrived in North America at w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)"
24398,"We dont think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
24399,"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
24400,"years ago, when my st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way"
24401,"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly"
24402,"Terms &amp; conditions for Not-a-Flamethrower Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple &amp; concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham."
24403,"Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: Not a Flamethrower."
24404,Yes
24405,Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher. Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
24406,"Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty match to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs."
24407,Coming soon
24408,I think so
24409,Nothing makes your baby more zen than a few gentle puffs of a TBC Flamethrower
24410,First Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today!
24411,Were building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome
24412,Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model Performance version.
24413,Gigafactory should be on % renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
24414,"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with % larger inner diameter"
24415,And were definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
24416,"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form"
24417,Running track in BF Spaceship will look something like this
24418,"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model cars."
24419,Working on improving
24420,"No way mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, mins is obv right."
24421,"Oh please, thats obv overkill"
24422,Tip of the day
24423,Coming soon
24424,"We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to months though, not years."
24425,Congratulations . Good move by . Please use Matts Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor
24426,"Yup, we are extending the net area by a factor of"
24427,"Am def not under any illusion that this will end illiteracy, but I hope it helps at least a little"
24428,"Good morning, Sonic. Not sure how to break it to you, but"
24429,We have about projects underway in Puerto Rico
24430,Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
24431,You should get an invite to configure in next few days
24432,Definitely
24433,"Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob wont offer Model leases for to months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
24434,Model Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. Its a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model cars in stores within to weeks.
24435,Next year
24436,Twitter is so dark
24437,No no
24438,That is horrifying

24444,"Usually, they dont even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so."
24445,Actually true!
24446,"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
24447,"But dont worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everythings just fine"
24448,"Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each cars exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
24449,The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
24450,Glad youre ok!
24451,Some details on the Tesla air filtration system
24452,Mid for RHD
24453,That sounds like a fun adventure!
24454,You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
24455,"Model should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little on S/X."
24456,"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind"
24457,"Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model ."

24465,Finders keepers
24466,Hi !
24467,Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
24468,Hell of a week
24469,Just for perspective
24470,"True, no one is perfect"
24471,Youre most welcome. More to come in this regard.
24472,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism."
24473,"Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day , but theres always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure % below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
24474,Prob
24475,Yes
24476,"All items below will go to all Model s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say bug report followed by issue description."
24477,Pneumatic means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
24478,"Braking &amp; UI upgrades apply to all Model s. Improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless youre really bothered by them, dont replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. psi is best range, but lower comfort."
24479,"Yeah, absolutely"
24480,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from . Road noise &amp; ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.
24481,Like you guys too
24482,"Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube &amp; each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."
24483,"Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should."
24484,Good progress. Really proud of this design &amp; SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
24485,Peace
24486,Love the space cowboy esthetic
24487,"At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence &amp; abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all."
24488,"Youre saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language &amp; ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a good person?"
24489,This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!
24490,"Nano is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Wouldve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
24491,"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying Im against science is like saying Beyonc doesnt know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
24492,"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didnt set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science &amp; I said that was false. Are you saying I dont have the right to deny false accusations? Thats messed up."
24493,"Youve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that Im against science, then cherrypicked tweets that dont represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
24494,Great book. Read it when it came out.
24495,Exactly
24496,SpaceX has Area at Cape Canaveral. Thats better than .
24497,Yeah
24498,Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
24499,Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
24500,Yes
24501,"There are no aliens. Officially, at least"
24502,You have so many great pics &amp; factoids!
24503,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money."
24504,I really want to make this cupholder
24505,"A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size &amp; stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp &amp; dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice."
24506,Ive literally had dreams about cup holder designs
24507,Noted. We can prob adjust spring force &amp; catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
24508,Youre welcome. Appreciate the letter.
24509,Good school
24510,Had a great time with my kids
24511,Yes
24512,"Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isnt showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by powerful people &amp; my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media."
24513,Thanks
24514,Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
24515,"Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by powerful people that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
24516,Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
24517,Youre right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off
24518,Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
24519,Youre missing the point &amp; living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesnt trust you. This was true *before* the last election &amp; only got worse. Dont believe me? Run your own poll
24520,"Youre welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming Im against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
24521,You really think I havent spent time in a newsroom? Ive spent time in too many. Bleak.
24522,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
24523,"Yup, deleted"
24524,? It should
24525,"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking &amp; will ride tire traction limit. You wont notice sport brakes unless youre on a racetrack &amp; have the sticky tires."
24526,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks for excellent critical feedback!"
24527,"Yes, Model Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes"
24528,Keyword future
24529,Will do another rev before final design
24530,I was
24531,Thats what I had in mind
24532,Sometimes even I think were the same person!
24533,"Nanotech *is* bs imo. When you take something that has nothing to do w gender &amp; make it about that, you devalue genuine gender issues."
24534,"About to ship. holding flamethrower pickup parties in a week or so, then deliveries begin. Check for details."
24535,Its not
24536,Thats a great song!
24537,"Sometimes when I have hurt feelings, I play this song"
24538,"No, thats the other guy"
24539,So true
24540,Because Twitter is fun
24541,USAToday FTW!
24542,Dank is wack unless youre on weed
24543,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this non-journalist who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
24544,But femtotech is the future
24545,Nanotech is so . Picotech is times better.
24546,"Yeah, thats exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought."
24547,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
24548,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that dumb public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...
24549,A Tesla has a usable reserve of to miles range even after the battery reads empty. This will not hurt the pack.
24550,"Pretty good. TinTin A &amp; B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."
24551,"Its cool for kids &amp; if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a rocket scientist in aerospace, they would think youre"
24552,I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away &amp; our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause
24553,Does the psych ward know you smuggled in a mobile phone?
24554,The pain will end
24555,"Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening"
24556,Gwynne has been prez of SpaceX for years &amp; well-deserved
24557,"Stop trying to charm me. It wont work. Ok, maybe a little Are you a real person or a bot?"
24558,"Using rocket science non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on"
24559,What are you talking about? Youre being incredibly rude &amp; nonsensical.
24560,"Wow, havent watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
24561,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
24562,Cant believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
24563,"We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"
24564,Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
24565,Prob end of next year
24566,"Good point, we will add that to the construction plan"
24567,"Global map of Tesla Superchargers, including those coming soon"
24568,"Earths rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
24569,Youre making my point. Its tragic that theres a national nano day. I wish I didnt know that.
24570,All four. Zone throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
24571,Model was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
24572,This is the new production line for battery module Zone . Will play a key role in getting from /week to /week for Model .
24573,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
24574,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in when we were just figuring things out."
24575,Worth a shot
24576,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. Its called satire
24577,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
24578,"Problem solved, was able to buy ! Game on"
24579,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didnt correct me on this!"
24580,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd"
24581,"Turns out is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
24582,"For some reason, Russia didnt bother to correct me"
24583,"Tried to buy , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
24584,"Definitely did not. Ive been through many press cycles &amp; know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
24585,Ive just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. Its amazing that you dont understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
24586,The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; were not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings Ive ever met. Youre the former.
24587,No
24588,Nano applies to everything &amp; therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.
24589,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that havent been unveiled yet. You dont have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
24590,"Wow, youre ignorant. Dont remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didnt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
24591,Done
24592,Have a confirmed real name identity section &amp; an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
24593,Be careful what you wish for
24594,"Amazingly, the media is awesome vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll"
24595,My point exactly
24596,"Ahem, you have nano in your bio. That is % synonymous with bs."
24597,Reddit is great
24598,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
24599,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They dont realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
24600,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
24601,I did to any who asked
24602,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didnt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
24603,"Maybe after you get your Model , we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved"
24604,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March is about right."
24605,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
24606,Gasoline or diesel?
24607,What car do you drive?
24608,March
24609,The media
24610,"Hi Kara! Im open to it. Right now, Im cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
24611,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called Youre Right! I do actually own , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
24612,Definitely
24613,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these and this is the best one"
24614,Yo
24615,Thats the basic idea
24616,"For some reason, this is the best Ive felt in a while. Hope youre feeling good too"
24617,"I just tried to donate, but you dont accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
24618,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
24619,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious
24620,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
24621,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
24622,"If youre in media &amp; dont want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it"
24623,"Ive never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They havent forgotten UAW betrayed them. Thats why UAW cant even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
24624,Of course
24625,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but were doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company."
24626,"No, theyre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
24627,Will do
24628,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
24629,Thats why editors are included too
24630,We dont. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
24631,"Even if some of the public doesnt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves."
24632,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
24633,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
24634,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
24635,Exactly
24636,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda"
24637,An exception that proves the rule
24638,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
24639,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesnt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among worlds biggest advertisers."
24640,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
24641,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks hes above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
24642,"Thought youd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks Youre just like Trump! Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
24643,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them"
24644,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis &amp; Oblivion"
24645,I am not cool
24646,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
24647,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so Im glad theres some good too . Her music is incredible."
24648,Thanks. Not super fun right now
24649,Busted
24650,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
24651,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics &amp; backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
24652,Great idea!
24653,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
24654,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
24655,Interesting he stops at . Thats when you drove GM &amp; Chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
24656,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. Its an off-menu item for those in the know
24657,"But ya know what, lets test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is /2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Lets hold a vote &amp; find out."
24658,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost + jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it."
24659,"Were going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; . What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
24660,Good point
24661,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of class lords &amp; commoners system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
24662,"More Reveal bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; theyve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article"
24663,No problem
24664,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
24665,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
24666,I didnt meet with him
24667,I definitely dont do this minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Cant be creative otherwise.
24668,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
24669,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasnt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
24670,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
24671,"To be clear, all Model cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Todays Model S is far more refined than initial production."
24672,ABS calibration algorithm
24673,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
24674,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla wont stop until Model has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
24675,"Stop, youre making me blush"
24676,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model Performance power output a little"
24677,Complexity is the devil. Words cant express how hard we are working on the Model production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But well try.
24678,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
24679,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time weve seen anything like this."
24680,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
24681,"Very strange. Model is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
24682,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didnt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar.com."
24683,Gwynnes awesome. Been SpaceX prez for years. Super love working with her.
24684,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
24685,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
24686,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as facts by Reveal."
24687,Were working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak &amp; pinpoint origin by acoustic signature &amp; triangulation
24688,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to Plum Brook vacuum chamber
24689,For sure before snowfall this year
24690,It can tow far more than rated capacity
24691,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
24692,"With production, st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need to months after k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live."
24693,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
24694,Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on whats happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
24695,"Yeah, Reveal was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as todays non-union."
24696,"About % of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
24697,Yes
24698,Exactly
24699,They can form a union whenever they want &amp; theres nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just dont want to.
24700,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. Its like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
24701,"They are correct. Its awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
24702,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you cant tell"
24703,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model in July.
24704,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about /week right now."
24705,Good idea ...
24706,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
24707,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
24708,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also miles. Takes -60mph to sec &amp; top speed to mph.
24709,Black &amp; white interior available only for Model Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
24710,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
24711,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but % quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
24712,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model : sec -60mph mph Top Speed mile Range"
24713,"Its only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
24714,Exactly
24715,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
24716,Im about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
24717,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
24718,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
24719,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior."
24720,"AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in."
24721,Working on Model dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
24722,Check out . Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
24723,But The Boring Company is right behind you at /15th your speed &amp; soon will be /10th! Start sweating
24724,He taunts us with his speed
24725,Just an ordinary snail
24726,His name is Gary &amp; hes a snail
24727,Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever
24728,Excited for partnership with LA Metro
24729,lol
24730,Listening to REALiTi
24731,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
24732,Yes
24733,Will be presenting &amp; taking questions about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at pm on Thursday
24734,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in to mins
24735,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
24736,"It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
24737,Whats actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
24738,"Its super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage"
24739,Yes
24740,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every M miles in (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every M miles. Its not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
24741,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx X better than avg."
24742,Happy Mothers Day Mom! Love you so much.
24743,"Fair criticism, but were fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
24744,Lovely story
24745,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I cant figure them out."
24746,"SpaceX will prob build to rocket cores for ~300 missions over years. Then BFR takes over &amp; Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars &amp; eventually outer planets."
24747,Good piece by Ars
24748,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
24749,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines quaint, but not something youd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general."
24750,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
24751,Yo
24752,Will make that a setting
24753,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, hours a day, days a week"
24754,No use arguing with chimp. Youre blocked.
24755,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass"
24756,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever
24757,Launching in ~4 mins
24758,"AWD &amp; white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, thats when we *start* making them. Cant instantly fill all orders. Will take + months to do so."
24759,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange"
24760,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
24761,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
24762,A cool thing about the design is thats easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
24763,Already started DC to NY route. Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels &amp; faster than jetliner.
24764,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final
24765,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country &amp; will be there in person for the launch."
24766,"This will work on entire S &amp; X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
24767,"All X &amp; S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high &amp; you enable feature"
24768,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
24769,!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.
24770,I wrote that masterpiece myself in HTML
24771,"Wow, thanks for the couch! I will match the donation from my foundation."
24772,My a capella cover of Amish Paradise is irresistible
24773,Tesla quarterly all-hands video. Love the shot of wild horses &amp; Giga in winter
24774,So rococo
24775,Definitely not a logo of any kind

24779,Hi Danielle!
24780,"Dont want to blow your mind, but Im pretty weird. Its time the world knew."
24781,Night at the museum. G has mad skillzsz. Me not so much.
24782,Literally every word is untrue
24783,"Thats a white rose on my jacket &amp; the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything"
24784,This chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels &amp; the artists only a small fraction of these numbers
24785,"Prob iTunes, but whatever works u is fine. Most people dont buy music &amp; artist earnings from streaming are tiny. Mostly about touring."

24793,Warren Buffett is huge in candy. Its actually true.
24794,Im killin me lol
24795,lol
24796,Hi Sarah
24797,Then Im going to build a moat &amp; fill it w candy. Warren B will not be able to resist investing! Berkshire Hathaway kryptonite
24798,Cryptocandy
24799,"Ok ok, just for sake of argument, what do u wish for in candy?"
24800,What do you think were living in?
24801,It just occurred to me that the plot of Willy Wonka is really messed up
24802,I am super super serious
24803,Im starting a candy company &amp; its going to be amazing
24804,This will be bigger
24805,I try so hard to help them
24806,Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
24807,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If youre short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit"
24808,New Roadster will have that
24809,"Yes, definitely not"
24810,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
24811,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
24812,Yup
24813,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
24814,"We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model , as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
24815,"Reason RBC question about Model demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching k/week production, it would take years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to ."
24816,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
24817,"The questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
24818,Exactly
24819,"First, its important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while"
24820,Please ignore this thread unless youre interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
24821,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
24822,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model is about to do same."
24823,"To be clear, Im a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
24824,"The dry questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
24825,Youre most welcome
24826,Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is rd in world after a place &amp; mall. Giga will be largest when complete.

24842,Mostly not
24843,Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at locations in Puerto Rico. Team is working /7 to activate several hundred more.
24844,Russia has great rocket technology &amp; talent. Much respect. Would encourage focus on reusability. Single-use rockets cannot be competitive any more than single-use aircraft.
24845,Doing our best
24846,Now
24847,Driving a Model and playing
24848,"Yeah, exactly! Would be great to hear your thoughts. Were going to try a few approaches. Can def be done, just about minimizing mass."
24849,"We already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in Pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesnt become a dead satellite. Need to retarget closer to shore &amp; position catcher ship like Mr Steven."
24850,And then land on a bouncy house
24851,"Yeah, but great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all Mach regimes &amp; drops ballistic coefficient by orders of magnitude"
24852,SpaceX will try to bring rocket upper stage back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon
24853,"This is gonna sound crazy, but"
24854,Interview and Tesla factory tour with Gayle King
24855,Too wasted to remember
24856,"Dont want to brag or anything, but that happens to me sometimes"
24857,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
24858,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now its just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable &amp; cash flow+ in Q3 &amp; Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
24859,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is to months."
24860,Looking into it. This is bizarre.
24861,Maybe a little
24862,Gwynnes got it covered. Shes awesome.
24863,I love trolls
24864,Norway has some really cool tunnels and bridges

24869,SpaceX main body tool for the BFR interplanetary spaceship
24870,Free viewing ends in about hours
24871,Definitely. Will take corrective action immediately. Sorry about this.
24872,Looking into it now
24873,Should just be due to your config not avail yet. If not lmk.
24874,Similar timing
24875,So probably July
24876,We need to achieve k/week with Model before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp
24877,"This is kinda nutty for such a short distance, so could easily end up being shredded metal, but exciting either way"
24878,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
24879,Model is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.
24880,The cat videos are awesome
24881,at M views after hours. Congrats to Chris Paine &amp; co!

24888,This is false
24889,"Oh, its on"
24890,Most people dont know theres a whole box of Easter eggs with every Tesla. Just tap logo on center screen &amp; wait. Easy access to most of discovered ones. More coming
24891,"Uhh, hello, I need to build cars"
24892,"About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we dont design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so Im back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell"
24893,"Cant believe youre even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on whats most critical, which is currently Model production. Doug, who I regard as one of the worlds most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
24894,"We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesnt matter."
24895,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. Im sure theres a really great answer"
24896,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
24897,"Seriously! Obviously, Im not going to do an April Fools joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
24898,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."
24899,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven"
24900,What about this?
24901,Elon University is a real place
24902,Coming soon to Tesla merch. Free shots in stores every April st.
24903,As you wish
24904,Its the best
24905,"Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model , surrounded by ""Teslaquilla"" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks. This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point? Happy New Month!"
24906,"There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter and a half (the worst one)."
24907,"Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April , -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."
24908,Important news in a few hours

24920,"Turns out joking about being a rock star because of digging tunnels (through, uh, rock hello??) is deeply underappreciated"
24921,"Yes, you can upgrade hardware, although we also wrote software to accelerate rendering on old MCU. Coming out soon &amp; makes a big diff."
24922,"From my Mom: every time I use irony, I lose a friend"
24923,And they said Id never be a rock star
24924,Yes

24930,"New Boring Company merch coming soon. Lifesize LEGO-like interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to create sculptures &amp; buildings. Rated for California seismic loads, so super strong, but bored in the middle, like an aircraft wing spar, so not heavy."
24931,"New nav starts rolling out this weekend. Should be considered a mature beta at first, so wont be perfect, but will improve rapidly. With the old system, we were stuck with legacy rd party black box code and stale data. No way to improve."
24932,Shocker
24933,Its not a political statement and I didnt do this because someone dared me to do it. Just dont like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.
24934,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness &amp; safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
24935,Youll live
24936,Weve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
24937,"Instagrams probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I dont use FB &amp; never have, so dont think Im some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we dont advertise or pay for endorsements, so dont care."
24938,Ok
24939,"What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
24940,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
24941,Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
24942,First time Ive seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
24943,Maybe that word doesnt mean what I think it does
24944,Literally never seen it even once
24945,"Yeah, its borderline. FB influence is slowly creeping in."
24946,I didnt realize there was one. Will do.
24947,Inconceivable! Whod say a thing like that!?
24948,Whats Facebook?
24949,"Wow, a whole week. Risky ..."
24950,Umm...yes
24951,Yes
24952,I double-dare them to come back! Bring it ...
24953,No technology is too advanced for The Boring Company!
24954,"That said, Lori deserves a lot of credit for supporting competitive, commercial space launch while under massive assault from old-school monopolists"
24955,"No real surface is perfect, but it did pull about lbs of muck rail cars out of a tunnel"
24956,"Probably mid next year before we are able to make RHD. Wish it could be sooner. Maybe try a Model S, used or new in the meantime? Used S is better than a new imo, unless you want a smaller car."
24957,Sorry
24958,"Model X pulls a lb (15,000 above US road legal limit) semi truck on a pure snow surface"
24959,Thanks!
24960,Sounds like this canton has style!
24961,Ok
24962,Youre welcome. Sorry for the delay. Only just got back from Gigafactory. Will be at our Fremont factory in the morning. Tesla team is going all out.

24967,"Lori, this is ridiculous. Creating a rocket company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to make money. If it was about money, Id just do another Internet company."
24968,This is completely false. Never even heard of Cortica. Just taking my kids on a Spring Break trip to see ancient historical sites in Israel &amp; Jordan.

24985,Doesnt make any sense. You cant take things that fail &amp; make them work without creativity &amp; invention.
24986,"No, its not"
24987,None of the above
24988,Tunnels
24989,Because blue
24990,"I guess you could say its a mph, underground, autonomous, electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. So, yes, a bus."

24992,"Boring Co urban loop system would have s of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination &amp; blend seamlessly into the fabric of a city, rather than a small number of big stations like a subway"
24993,Definitely

24999,"To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing."
25000,"We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable."
25001,"I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. Its like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes."
25002,"Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even % of their own factory in China, but there are five % China-owned EV auto companies in the US"
25003,"For example, an American car going to China pays % import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays %, a tenfold difference"
25004,"Do you think the US &amp; China should have equal &amp; fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints &amp; other factors."

25013,"Falcon flight launches tonight, carrying Hispasat for Spain. At metric tons and almost the size of a city bus, it will be the largest geostationary satellite weve ever flown."
25014,"Very sensible summary of supersonic flight. Obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag &amp; low boom amplitude at ground. If boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too."
25015,Good points. Will add to feature list.
25016,"Yeah, that should improve soon. Software team has been buried in Model bringup and tricky bug fixes, but thats mostly done now."
25017,Almost done

25021,"Higher safety &amp; environmental requirements &amp; labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy &amp; a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost."

25045,"Todays Falcon launch carries SpaceX test satellites for global broadband. If successful, Starlink constellation will serve least served."
25046,Strange though. Delta IV Heavy has half the payload of Falcon Heavy and the BO rocket doesnt exist yet.
25047,I dont get the little ship thing. You cant show up at Mars in something the size of a rowboat. What if there are Martians? It would be so embarrassing.

25051,Adding software feature to open glovebox automatically when car comes to a stop after a crash. Will look at bonding a thin plastic sheet to the front or back of screen.
25052,Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block . SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
25053,Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.

25055,No

25057,A third is under construction
25058,"Under consideration. Weve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing , flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected."
25059,"Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."
25060,Of course
25061,"Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before"
25062,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after . Nutty high."
25063,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
25064,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

25096,Customs problem solved!
25097,Or maybe Temperature Enhancement Device
25098,"Apparently, some customs agencies are saying they wont allow shipment of anything called a Flamethrower. To solve this, we are renaming it Not a Flamethrower."
25099,"Early access build and especially Dev build are feature-rich, but the features arent reliable enough yet"
25100,Release candidate in final testing phase
25101,No
25102,I think weve figured it out
25103,Yes
25104,"Small detail, but each one will come with a serial number from to"
25105,A snowthrower would be really fun
25106,All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher
25107,Flamethrowers sold out
25108,Of course
25109,Yes
25110,"This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didnt hurt the droneship, but amazingly it has survived. We will try to tow it back to shore."
25111,"Woz is a lovable, fuzzy bear"

25123,"But wait, theres more: the flamethrower is sentient, its safe word is cryptocurrency and it comes with a free blockchain"
25124,Ok
25125,Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
25126,Youd need millions of zombies for a so-called apocalypse anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
25127,The rumor that Im secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
25128,Good thing you didnt ask about the Freezegun ...
25129,Hmmm
25130,Unless you like fun
25131,"Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely dont buy one."
25132,"ordered already, only left!"
25133,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, youll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"
25134,Dont do this
25135,ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. Id be way more scared of a steak knife.
25136,Great for roasting nuts
25137,The Boring Company flamethrower guaranteed to liven up any party!
25138,Say hello to my little friend
25139,Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb from Apollo launchpad A at Cape Kennedy. Easy viewing from the public causeway.
25140,Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so.
25141,Check for updates
25142,Done
25143,"Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
25144,There arent even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
25145,"Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
25146,That sounds cool. Will do.
25147,Fixed in next release
25148,"Long exposure of rocket ascent, reentry from space and landing burn. (Credit )"
25149,Good idea. We can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.

25161,Thanks Jon!
25162,"satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
25163,Background on the launch
25164,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
25165,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
25166,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
25167,Meant to reply to this article:
25168,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
25169,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
25170,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
25171,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
25172,About mins from static fire
25173,holding for issue resolution
25174,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
25175,mins from static fire test
25176,"yes, from F to F"
25177,It worked in Texas
25178,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
25179,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
25180,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
25181,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
25182,Announcing formation of
25183,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
25184,Agreed. Working on it.
25185,wow
25186,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
25187,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
25188,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
25189,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
25190,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
25191,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
25192,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
25193,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
25194,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
25195,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
25196,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
25197,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
25198,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
25199,Yeah and hell yeah
25200,From anywhere
25201,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
25202,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
25203,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
25204,definitely aliens!
25205,Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
25206,well done!
25207,noted
25208,"Wow, that's great!"
25209,Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves sec -60 mph and sec /4 mile in Motor Trend test
25210,"yes, comes with each car"
25211,"Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit"
25212,I should clarify that is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
25213,Cool!
25214,"Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
25215,"Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term."
25216,"Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
25217,Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
25218,We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
25219,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
25220,Model is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
25221,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
25222,"important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
25223,Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
25224,"Autopilot coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
25225,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
25226,all
25227,Hoping for Friday release
25228,Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.

25821,"Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone."
25822,"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
25823,"Even if the answer is only on the order of %, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
25824,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
25825,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
25826,Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round
25827,"Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety"
25828,Exactly
25829,"In reality, % of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change"

25841,"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
25842,"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money"
25843,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
25844,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
25845,The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.

25855,"We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't."
25856,"And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?"

26635,Launch can be viewed live from Cape causeways or via webcast around :30 local time on Monday
26636,Easier to make the plane change to equatorial orbit. Done in order to reduce satellite side delta V from m/s to m/s.
26637,Will be toughest mission to date. Requires coast + upper stage restart + going to km altitude (~1/4 way to moon).
26638,Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first geostationary satellite launch.
26639,Tesla Model S Consumer Reports customer satisfaction survey highest of any car on road at /100
26640,Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident
26641,What makes this incredibly unjust is that the Model S to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
26642,Why does a Tesla fire w no injury get more media headlines than gas car fires that kill s of people per year?
26643,Mission of Tesla

26743,"Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone."
26744,"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
26745,"Even if the answer is only on the order of %, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
26746,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
26747,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
26748,Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round
26749,"Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety"
26750,Exactly
26751,"In reality, % of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change"

26763,"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
26764,"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money"
26765,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
26766,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
26767,The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
26768,"Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first years, got IPO+ govt money for , now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
26769,"There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census."
26770,"Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases."
26771,"Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide."
26772,"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad."
26773,"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (), who lives in NC"
26774,Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.

26776,Don't like having a zillion tweets in the log. Makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history.
26777,"We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't."
26778,"And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?"

26823,"Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places."
26824,"Yeah, that probably makes sense."
26825,Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time.
26826,"yes, that has been the goal from the beginning"
26827,"It can definitely strain relationships, but I loved doing my first company with my brother"

26831,we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
26832,Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good?
26833,"Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system."
26834,Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
26835,"Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners."
26836,Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry
26837,Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky
26838,"We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway."
26839,"Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform."

26841,"The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about degrees to deploy"
26842,More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
26843,We did a ton of testing until they could handle X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
26844,High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
26845,"F9R (pronounced F-niner) shows a little leg. Design is a nested, telescoping piston w A frame."
26846,This is about getting a prior announcement right. Not part yet.

26895,No more political comments for me now that I've shot off both my feet.
26896,"When a person dies, the right thing to do is remember the good more than the bad. Not a day for hate (if there is ever such)."
26897,"At the risk of losing more ""cool points"", I like Reagan too! However, I also like Obama, Clinton &amp; JFK. Good people on both sides..."

26909,Should be late for US and early for Europe.
26910,July!
26911,Am headed to TX next week to thank people personally for supporting Tesla. Please head to SB am tomorrow
26912,Certainly true that many people believe that Tesla and SpaceX are powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive
26913,Today's Tesla announcement is actually the nd in a part trilogy (love Douglas Adams)
26914,You never know ...
26915,Thanks Michael. Beauty of over the air software updates is that the product keeps improving even after you buy it.

27533,Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
27534,Tesla keeps temp below C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
27535,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
27536,This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
27537,"V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments."
27538,"Yeah, definitely one of my favorite names"
27539,its it is
27540,Preview of the interplanetary transport system at
27541,that's a great one
27542,sounds like the right name for the rocket booster
27543,That is my favorite fictional spaceship. Powered by improbability!
27544,yeah!
27545,"Maybe Ultimate Spaceship, Version ? Mostly because it is not the ultimate and there isn't a version ."
27546,I love the suggestions!
27547,sounds about right
27548,"Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars, so will need a new name"
27549,yes
27550,won't affect performance
27551,Hoping to start WW rollout of on Wednesday if no last minute issues discovered.
27552,Tesla P100D put to the test by Drag Times
27553,Glad you like it! I think we will probably stop at kWh on battery size.

27559,Will do some press Q&amp;A on Autopilot post at am PDT tmrw and then publish at noon. Sorry about delay. Unusually difficult couple of weeks.
27560,Thoughtful Op-ed in Space News much appreciated
27561,"Most likely true, but we can't yet find it on any vehicle sensors"
27562,Will get back to Autopilot update blog tomorrow.
27563,We have not ruled that out.
27564,"nope, it wasn't me"
27565,Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
27566,"Support &amp; advice from , , &amp; others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report.com."
27567,Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
27568,Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in years.
27569,It's been a little crazy lately
27570,"yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine."
27571,Finishing Autopilot blog postponed to end of weekend
27572,Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
27573,"Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change."
27574,We need to do one more minor rev on and then will go to wide release in a few weeks
27575,Writing post now with details. Will publish on Tesla website later today.
27576,Major improvements to Autopilot coming with V8.0 and software (std OTA update) primarily through advanced processing of radar signals
27577,uh oh
27578,Thanks for the longstanding faith in SpaceX. We very much look forward to doing this milestone flight with you.
27579,one of my favorite games as a kid
27580,Making progress. Maybe something to announce in a few months. Have played all prior Deus Ex. Not this one yet.
27581,Journalist Q&amp;A for mins and embargo ends at :30
27582,Tesla product announcement at noon California time today
27583,Owner account of a Model X severely impacted by a Yukon
27584,Correlation is not causality or ... is it?
27585,Sunday morning: to bake or not to bake cookies -- that is not even a question. Definitely bake.
27586,"Congrats to on her novel, ""Acts of Love""! All characters even those based on real people are entirely fictional"
27587,Over the entrance of
27588,true
27589,Will try out this weekend. Maybe reality is just a series of nested simulations all the way down ...
27590,Would like to thank and Jensen for donating the first DGX-1 AI supercomputer to in support of democratizing AI technology
27591,"Yeah. Movie still enjoyable due to some great characters, but plot &amp; editing could've been better. Really needed more Joker+Harley."
27592,Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots
27593,Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
27594,probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
27595,Model Y (compact SUV) off Model chassis. Tesla Bus/Minibus/Spacebus off Model X.
27596,good point
27597,I think we should be inconsistent in our naming conventions after Model Y
27598,View of Dragon from cupola
27599,We are definitely patenting this idea
27600,glad people had a great time!
27601,"not bad, I like those suggestions"
27602,Gigafactory in units of hamster
27603,Some good guessing by . The Tesla Minibus will be built on a Model X chassis. People density potential is surprisingly high.
27604,Will be live streaming the Gigafactory launch party tonight. Check this eve.
27605,The libertarian argument for a carbon tax
27606,"Good summary of yesterday's Gigafactory Q&amp;A with JB, Yamada-San and me"
27607,Should mention that Gigafactory will be fully powered by clean energy when complete &amp; include battery recycling
27608,happy birthday!

27612,Maybe as a future optimization. Would only matter if it was extremely big.
27613,as long as I'm alive
27614,Looking forward to the Gigafactory opening party on Friday next week. The scale blows me away every time I see it.
27615,Autopilot prevents serious injury or death of a pedestrian in NY (owner anecdote confirmed by vehicle logs)
27616,"Jerome is driving Tesla Semi &amp; doing a great job with his team. At Daimler, he led their most successful semi truck program ever."
27617,It's inspired by some of the California Custom VW combi design art
27618,Great game. Whole Fallout series is amazing.
27619,Both should have been done under the same corporate umbrella from the beginning
27620,"Tesla Master Plan, Part Deux"
27621,now Pac
27622,California time
27623,Post should go live on Tesla website around pm
27624,yup
27625,busted
27626,Except for the tweet about large amounts of crack (actually just small amounts)
27627,Not easy to convey irony in a tweet
27628,Lana
27629,Finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from Gatsby. Seems appropriate...
27630,"Will be working at Tesla on Autopilot &amp; Model today, then aiming to pull an all-nighter and complete the master product plan"
27631,I am!
27632,Returning from Cape Canaveral to California...
27633,"Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket"
27634,Can't wait to see all three cores of Falcon Heavy come back for landings! First two will be almost simultaneous.
27635,Landing
27636,free Babel fish provided
27637,Bit of a distraction yesterday. Working on plan today.
27638,Out on LZ-1. We just completed the post-landing inspection and all systems look good. Ready to fly again.
27639,Falcon on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
27640,"Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they're so much smarter than Tesla owners that ""they know better"". Makes no sense."
27641,"V8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day."
27642,"Tesla customers are v smart &amp; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: % want it disabled -- not %, %."
27643,"It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection"
27644,Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
27645,Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.
27646,That is a very good point!
27647,Have to focus on tonight's launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
27648,"Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla."
27649,"Promising call today with , maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update."
27650,much appreciated
27651,Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.
27652,Sensible article on Autopilot by guardian
27653,On the other hand I do answer a toy phone like it's real
27654,large amounts of crack
27655,"hours normally, but a lot less these days"
27656,Sunday is the end of the week
27657,yes
27658,good up to ~160km/h
27659,Our radar is using a wavelength of mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
27660,especially well
27661,Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
27662,"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
27663,yes
27664,certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
27665,effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
27666,elevation too
27667,only just gained access to physical vehicle
27668,AP process crash would show up in logs
27669,"Working on using existing Tesla radar by itself (decoupled from camera) w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point cloud, like lidar"
27670,"Maybe didn't realize he turned it off, but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument cluster."
27671,exactly
27672,"Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on."
27673,EU regulators find no safety concerns with Autopilot
27674,It's all fun &amp; games until ...
27675,We don't mind taking the heat for customer safety. It is the right thing to do. From
27676,can't wait to see the costume
27677,Only if I can play a monkey
27678,"Tesla finishes last in being salesy! Good. Also, I can't believe there is a real Pied Piper."
27679,Something like that
27680,already taken care of
27681,Kinda. Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery &amp; solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason
27682,I like your tweets!
27683,"Tricky in chars, but: B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that."
27684,Blog on Autopilot by
27685,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
27686,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before B.
27687,"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
27688,"With less than B miles, there simply isn't enough data. B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
27689,"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
27690,exactly
27691,"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
27692,why?
27693,thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
27694,Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
27695,"you're right, no point"
27696,"Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."
27697,"Misunderstanding of what ""beta"" means to Tesla for Autopilot: any system w less than B miles of real world driving"
27698,Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
27699,"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part . Hoping to publish later this week."
27700,"Story was fed to LAT &amp; many other media to counter IMF $5T/year fossil subsidy study. Hey, both have a !"
27701,seriously
27702,Love reddit. Gandel gets shredded &amp; won't even answer top upvoted questions. Some really funny comments about Koch
27703,"Model S had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA, which is why ..."
27704,thanks
27705,"true, good point"
27706,"No, you were misleading mostly on your own, but w many copycats. Jalopnik just lost it's sense of irony &amp; didn't get my tweet."
27707,"cool, thanks"
27708,The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
27709,"In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert."
27710,"Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert."
27711,"All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include."
27712,Tesla response to the misleading Fortune articles about Autopilot
27713,Sponsored articles
27714,Because of course I hate flamingos...(maybe try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your salad)
27715,Exactly! I love Twitter.
27716,Wrong to exclude non-occupant deaths. Autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed
27717,"If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about M+/year deaths from other auto companies?"
27718,"Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market."
27719,Radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
27720,Our condolences for the tragic loss
27721,Shakespeare. Then love-devouring death do what he dare; It is enough I may but call her mine.
27722,aspirationally
27723,"My son recently asked what my favorite animal was. Well, of course"
27724,Thoughtful analysis of the Tesla/SolarCity merger by
27725,Thanks for the kind bday wishes!
27726,cute!
27727,exactly
27728,We haven't signed anything for a factory in China
27729,"Deluded, deranged, etc. Journalistic thesaurus sure got a lot of use last week ..."
27730,"Article is misleading to readers. No one is ""taking home"" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table."
27731,Of course. Our love will never die.
27732,This is going to be great
27733,Drive units and battery are sealed
27734,"If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential"
27735,"We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation."
27736,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side
27737,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. is the year of experimentation."
27738,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
27739,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
27740,Thanks Tyler
27741,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
27742,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
27743,Quite rapid... Yes
27744,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly
27745,Looks like thrust was low on of landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
27746,"Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship"
27747,Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll
27748,"Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will."
27749,"Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely."
27750,No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
27751,Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
27752,"That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics"
27753,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
27754,Latest science predicts &gt; trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens
27755,"Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious."
27756,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
27757,"Of greater concern: of suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
27758,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
27759,That is correct. It was about innovation.
27760,Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on
27761,no
27762,Something about a flying metal suit...
27763,yes
27764,S and X cells are also Panasonic
27765,Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
27766,Fourth rocket arrives in the hangar. Aiming for first reflight in Sept/Oct.
27767,"PC, of course"
27768,Highly recommend by the good people of if you like ultrafast team FPS action
27769,Trippy
27770,I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
27771,Exactly
27772,Good article from explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to Tesla funding
27773,how did you know?
27774,Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
27775,exactly
27776,It is simulations all the way down
27777,"At this point, I'm really running out of crazy things to say. Any suggestions?"
27778,control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
27779,Just heard that Norway will ban new sales of fuel cars in . What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!!
27780,"Yay, baby made it home!"
27781,autosteering chutes will be added soon
27782,Recode interview with and via
27783,Supercharger policy explained well by : Will post detailed description soon. I think it's a good balance.
27784,Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by
27785,Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this &amp; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
27786,So it was good for you too ...
27787,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
27788,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
27789,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
27790,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
27791,Satellite deployed to km apogee. All looks good.
27792,mins to launch
27793,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
27794,Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
27795,"Flight is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
27796,Great image of ancient Mars
27797,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
27798,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
27799,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
27800,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
27801,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
27802,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
27803,Full height of Falcon boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
27804,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon , but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
27805,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
27806,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
27807,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
27808,yes
27809,yup
27810,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
27811,Three's company
27812,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
27813,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.
27814,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
27815,tambin te amo
27816,It's probably the Ambien
27817,Definitely
27818,Ok
27819,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
27820,coming soon
27821,Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
27822,I think so
27823,Max is just X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
27824,I love you too!
27825,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to km above Earth"
27826,Thank goodness all are ok
27827,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
27828,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
27829,Woohoo!!
27830,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
27831,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model soon if you want delivery"
27832,yes
27833,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
27834,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
27835,"Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
27836,Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
27837,next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
27838,exactly
27839,"sides def, center maybe"
27840,naturally
27841,Falcon Heavy thrust will be M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
27842,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to M lbf later this year. It is capable of M lbf in flight.
27843,F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be kg
27844,"No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
27845,No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
27846,Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract % to % for reusable booster payload.
27847,"Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce sigma reserve margin."
27848,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon and Heavy
27849,yes
27850,turns out it doesn't need securing
27851,yes
27852,"yes, several times"
27853,for sure
27854,things like this should be purged shortly
27855,+ for almost everything + for heat shields and a few other items.
27856,Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
27857,"JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
27858,System scan detected only % of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
27859,of course
27860,Temporary spike in some areas due to X rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
27861,"Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are , so speculation unlikely."
27862,Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
27863,checking into it ...
27864,will definitely do so
27865,"some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
27866,"It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
27867,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
27868,Dragon is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
27869,"A should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
27870,That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
27871,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well
27872,"Aiming for relaunch in to months, pending detailed examination and X refiring of a returned booster"
27873,We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.

27875,Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.
27876,Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck
27877,Godot Full play
27878,"Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where."
27879,me too!
27880,Great video history of Falcon by Kinematic
27881,needs latest update
27882,"Activate autopilot X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon."
27883,"Not from us, but it's awesome"
27884,"Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not"
27885,Thanks
27886,yes
27887,"Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think."
27888,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you."
27889,Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
27890,Thanks!
27891,Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
27892,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
27893,"Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none."
27894,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet
27895,Nickel is also in nickels
27896,"Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic."
27897,"Over k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only % ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation."
27898,the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
27899,"yes, will go all the way to Alaska"
27900,"Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter."
27901,we will
27902,Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
27903,We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
27904,Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche Turbo S to a Model X
27905,Model X review
27906,probably unwise
27907,"won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height"
27908,yes
27909,yes
27910,yes
27911,yes
27912,sounds good
27913,"Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells."
27914,Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
27915,"yes, coming this year"
27916,Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
27917,you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for .
27918,correct
27919,hopefully
27920,what's the link to that?
27921,"No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
27922,no problem
27923,Will cover whole country hopefully this year
27924,"yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
27925,less
27926,torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
27927,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
27928,"Model will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
27929,yes
27930,Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
27931,definitely
27932,should be addressed this year
27933,Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
27934,that's not the real steering system
27935,yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
27936,Some tweaking underway
27937,Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the . It feels like a spaceship.
27938,Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
27939,Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
27940,They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
27941,It will make sense after part of the Model unveil
27942,"A Model order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
27943,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
27944,We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
27945,There will be an optional tow hitch.
27946,Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
27947,Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
27948,"cool, thanks!"
27949,"Yes, if the trend continues, before"
27950,k Model orders by end of Sat
27951,Model design sketches
27952,"We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before production starts."
27953,They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
27954,"Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for . They deserve a lot of credit."
27955,"we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
27956,"yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
27957,and a few other things
27958,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe -30 people per store would line up, not . Gifts on order."
27959,Maybe /4 to /2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part of the unveil.
27960,"Will give an update tonight for the day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."
27961,k as of am this morning
27962,thanks!
27963,Now k orders
27964,of course
27965,"Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind &amp; geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night."
27966,def on the cards for the future
27967,should be within a week or two max
27968,"Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car."
27969,Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...
27970,"Thought it would slow way down today, but Model order count is now at k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly."
27971,"Model orders at in hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!"
27972,Will include India-wide Supercharger network
27973,sure!
27974,Coming in the mail
27975,Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).
27976,Just order the SpaceX option package!
27977,"Thanks for tuning in to the Model unveil Part ! Part is super next level, but that's for later"
27978,"yes, will cover whole country"
27979,yes
27980,sure is
27981,X and S will also be available
27982,"Adding several more countries to Model order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland."
27983,"Model orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person"
27984,Online ordering at will now open at :30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at :30.
27985,From almost anywhere
27986,Coming soon!
27987,"Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model . You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up."
27988,Model unveil will be webcast live at :30pm California time at
27989,"You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve."
27990,"Tomorrow is Part of the Model unveil. Part , which takes things to another level, will be closer to production."
27991,Model order day starting in Australia
27992,You can now buy cruise ship tickets for the Arctic passage. Seeing is believing.
27993,Great article by . Important to note max temp record. Too much attention on avg temp. Max matters most

27997,sure
27998,"Turn off recirc. Air exits thru rear vents. Snap in shade also avail from service, but I just tint the rear window."
27999,no
28000,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
28001,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was years away from achieving this.
28002,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
28003,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
28004,Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.
28005,"Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance."
28006,Target altitude of km achieved. Thanks for riding on Falcon ! Looking forward to future missions.
28007,We spoke earlier today and he said he would investigate the situation.
28008,. SpaceX has not donated to any presidential campaign

28010,MIT Technology Review
28011,checking ...
28012,exactly
28013,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
28014,Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
28015,Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
28016,AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
28017,"Great leg room for rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
28018,"yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
28019,"Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick seats unless you really need ."
28020,"That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
28021,Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
28022,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.
28023,Next gen Atlas robot
28024,coming later this year
28025,"There is no way it is only %, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as %."
28026,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or % for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
28027,Just wanted to thank Stu G for . Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
28028,Don't you already have a spaceship?
28029,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs
28030,Sigh
28031,Hi
28032,"yeah, that's a great one too"
28033,Little bit
28034,"Worth watching ""Nathan for You"" on Comedy Central, particularly the ""Dumb Starbucks"" and ""Mechanic/Realtor"" episodes"
28035,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning
28036,yes
28037,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
28038,"yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
28039,This baby Model S really is quite fun
28040,More details on Model unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
28041,yes
28042,No signature series for Model . Same reservation amount for all.
28043,global
28044,Model reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March and online April
28045,good point
28046,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
28047,Love this Tesla video made by
28048,My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret
28049,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
28050,Interesting name
28051,I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
28052,"My best guess for : ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in"
28053,Thanks Jeff
28054,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it"
28055,"Stage would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
28056,"Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
28057,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
28058,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
28059,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
28060,steel collet
28061,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
28062,probably
28063,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
28064,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
28065,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
28066,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine showed thrust fluctuations."
28067,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
28068,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions
28069,Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
28070,"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
28071,"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."
28072,First baby step in Tesla Summon capability now downloading over-the-air with V7.1
28073,"Worth reading The Machine Stops, an old story by E. M. Forster"
28074,"Falcon back in the hangar at Cape Canaveral. No damage found, ready to fire again."
28075,High res video of landing from the helo
28076,Live video from LZ-1
28077,Falcon standing on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
28078,thanks!
28079,There and back again
28080,Thanks Jon!
28081,"satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
28082,Background on the launch
28083,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
28084,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
28085,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
28086,Meant to reply to this article:
28087,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
28088,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
28089,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
28090,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
28091,About mins from static fire
28092,holding for issue resolution
28093,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
28094,mins from static fire test
28095,"yes, from F to F"
28096,It worked in Texas
28097,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
28098,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
28099,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
28100,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
28101,Announcing formation of
28102,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
28103,Agreed. Working on it.
28104,wow
28105,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
28106,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
28107,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
28108,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
28109,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
28110,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
28111,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
28112,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
28113,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
28114,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
28115,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
28116,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
28117,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
28118,Yeah and hell yeah
28119,From anywhere
28120,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
28121,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
28122,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
28123,definitely aliens!
28124,Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
28125,well done!
28126,noted
28127,"Wow, that's great!"
28128,Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves sec -60 mph and sec /4 mile in Motor Trend test
28129,"yes, comes with each car"
28130,"Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit"
28131,I should clarify that is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
28132,Cool!
28133,"Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
28134,"Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term."
28135,"Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
28136,Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
28137,We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
28138,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
28139,Model is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
28140,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
28141,"important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
28142,Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
28143,"Autopilot coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
28144,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
28145,all
28146,Hoping for Friday release
28147,Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.
28148,What esthetic and functionality improvements would you like to see in the UI overhaul? Or new features entirely?
28149,already in Jordan. Rest of states in region next year.
28150,thanks Bonnie
28151,planning to have a big opening in Mexico City soon and then proceed gradually to central and South America.
28152,me too:
28153,yay! Always happy to make others happy
28154,big UI update coming in V7.1
28155,"we won't be, but yes"
28156,"Tesla gets top rating of any company in service. Most important, CR says % of owners expect their next car to be a Tesla (the acid test)."
28157,Consumer Reports reliability survey includes a lot of early production cars. Already addressed in new cars.
28158,already there
28159,Congrats on driving a Tesla from LA to NY in just over two days!
28160,Autopilot release to Europe and Asia pending regulatory approval. Hopefully get the ok in the next few weeks.
28161,Watched the whole series. One of the best tv shows ever.
28162,"um, thanks, I like your work too"
28163,sure

28171,roughly days
28172,same
28173,Non-autopilot will have a new interface too. More comprehensive UI update coming with .
28174,yes
28175,Some exciting news this week: Tesla Version software with Autopilot goes to wide release on Thursday!
28176,"CH4 rapidly decays back to CO2 &amp; is absorbed by plants. What matters is adding new carbon to surface cycle from underground oil, gas &amp; coal."
28177,"Intentions are good, but massively overweights CH4's effect on climate."
28178,Tesla P85D (assembled in Tilburg) beats hp MacLaren from to km/h in Dutch magazine test
28179,"I didn't walk back anything, apart from media hype"
28180,yo
28181,"Regarding the watch, Jony &amp; his team created a beautiful design, but the functionality isn't compelling yet. By version , it will be."
28182,"Yo, I don't hate Apple. It's a great company with a lot of talented people. I love their products and I'm glad they're doing an EV."
28183,Peak temp increases due to climate change
28184,Mostly accurate and fun movie about Mars. Worth seeing.
28185,you can mount a rack to the roof via suction cups and still have one Falcon door work fine. Guaranteed up to mph.
28186,door is larger than opening and acts as an umbrella. Upper interior trim has hydrophobic coating.
28187,Front doors have a short arc and their interior panels are chamfered back
28188,"Model X Bioweapon Defense Mode definitely filters viruses btw, even the small ones. Has hospital operating room level filtering."
28189,"am def '2"""
28190,"CNN on how Falcon doors work in tight garages. Above ' ft, my height , doors work fine."
28191,Side view of Falcon Wing doors
28192,"thanks, that's a great idea. I think we can do that."
28193,"Btw, price of Model X is actually only $5k more than S. Lower cost versions coming later."
28194,California time
28195,Model X launch webcast live today pm at . Time to show the real thing.
28196,Great discussion about solar/batteries empowering rural communities

28198,It was super good
28199,Midnight dinner in Berlin
28200,"In expendable mode, Falcon Heavy can send a fully loaded Dragon to Mars or a light Dragon to Jupiter's moons. Europa mission wd be cool."
28201,Dragon is designed to land on any surface (liquid or solid) in the solar system. Am glad to see people thinking about applications!
28202,Researchers at propose using Falcon/Dragon for Mars sample return mission
28203,New model for evolution of intelligent life suggests probable emergence billion years ago near galactic center
28204,thanks!
28205,"Btw, not saying we *should* nuke Mars -- just layin' out a few options"
28206,First production cars will be handed over on Sept at our Fremont factory
28207,Definitely
28208,Lithium deal is not exclusive &amp; has many contingencies. The press on this matter is unwarranted.
28209,"$35k price, unveil in March, preorders start then."
28210,"Model , our smaller and lower cost sedan will start production in about years. Fully operational Gigafactory needed."
28211,"With same options, Model X is $5k more than an S due to greater size &amp; body complexity. Sig Series is fully loaded, hence high price."
28212,"I appreciate the kind words in the article, but, judging by the picture mods, it looks your Photoshop bill was very high."
28213,"True, but achieving a long range affordable electric vehicle has always been our long-term goal. Due in late !"

29512,"There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is ""What color?"". Don't need a configurator for that."
29513,"Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference."

29524,Not good. Sounds like some rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand &gt;&gt; supply. Taking action
29525,The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire &amp; train local team as fast as possible.
29526,"Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes &amp; shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums."
29527,"Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today"

29561,"Absolutely. Moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time."
29562,Does my hivemind count as me?
29563,Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters.
29564,In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.

29578,"Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary."
29579,Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.
29580,"NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately"
29581,"May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory"

29587,In about six months or so. Linked to dual motor config.
29588,We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it
29589,Tunnels are sealed to atmospheres of water &amp; gas pressure. Just need walls around the apertures.
29590,"Not sure, but probably"
29591,Feature coming soon
29592,"They're so real. Anyone going to that much trouble must really care. I'd gladly follow their commands, but they're so friggin obtuse"
29593,That's pretty much why we did it
29594,"Worth reading Life by . AI will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity, so lets get it right."
29595,Hyperloop (near) vacuum tube runs parallel to SpaceX on Jack Northrop Blvd. It is miles long and just under ft in diameter.
29596,"To be clear, a Hyperloop passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect (just for testing), nor uncomfortable acceleration"
29597,Brakes
29598,Will run the SpaceX pusher sled later this week and see what it can do
29599,"Moon base alpha (cheesy show, but I loved it) plus Mars"
29600,"Not that this is remotely equiv to man on the moon, but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it"
29601,"Actually, no, his architecture was different. Also, thinking of going to the moon and actually going to the moon are not the same thing."
29602,Hyperloop pod run by team WARR

29605,"Yes, it is"
29606,A tiny one
29607,"Btw, high accel only needed because tube is short. For passenger transport, this can be spread over + miles, so no spilt drinks."
29608,"No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"
29609,Call it ~800mph
29610,"Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only miles long. Very high accel/decel needed"
29611,"Congratulations to WARR team from Tech Univ Munich for winning nd competition! Peak speed of km/h, which is over mph!!"
29612,Just arrived at the competition final. Student teams have amazing talent!
29613,I hope they and any others trying to advance transport technology succeed
29614,"Exactly. Wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of SpaceX and Tesla, as the probability of failure was &gt;90%."
29615,"Sorry! Coming next year, along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US, Mexico and Central America."
29616,"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
29617,Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
29618,I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
29619,"The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."
29620,"From last year, but still my favorite video of the Falcon rocket booster returning from space"
29621,SpaceX and The Boring Company are running the Hyperloop competition

29624,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here:
29625,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
29626,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
29627,Neuralink is not raising money
29628,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
29629,"Max velocity: Mach Max altitude: km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
29630,Probably m or so
29631,Exactly. Yeah.
29632,Intentionally? Yes
29633,It is approximately the size of a carrot

29646,Yes
29647,Watching eclipse with sunglasses on through the Model S glass roof. Wow!
29648,SpaceX rocket factory as seen from space
29649,"Yeah, but not a priority right now"
29650,I'm not coming for anything. Just digging some tunnels and might draw a vacuum on some of them.
29651,"We are going to move all info and settings to the ""cloud"" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you"
29652,Pics of SpaceX spacesuit developed for NASA commercial crew program coming out next week. Undergoing ocean landing mobility/safety tests.
29653,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
29654,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
29655,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
29656,Will prob do something like that
29657,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
29658,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
29659,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
29660,Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.
29661,I love Kermit
29662,"But you can check it out on . Btw, this isn't a video, like cliff diving or fake rocket landings, that matters if it's reversed."
29663,Wigs me out too much. Deleting ...
29664,"Yes, just that the permitting process is slow"
29665,I want one too!
29666,"Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!"
29667,"The danger is def high for South Korea, due to proximity, but much less for distant targets like the US. SK anti-missile tech is excellent."
29668,"We certainly could, but, while not suggesting complacency, I'm confident that the US DoD and intelligence orgs have this covered"

29672,Biggest impediment to recognizing AI danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't
29673,Would like to express our appreciation to Microsoft for use of their Azure cloud computing platform. This required massive processing power.
29674,OpenAI + Dota
29675,It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
29676,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."
29677,"I sure hope so, but we can't take that for granted"
29678,"If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea."
29679,OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess &amp; Go.
29680,Coming soon ...
29681,Hi Mom!
29682,A level orc illusionist and dressmaker
29683,This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least seconds checking your facts.
29684,Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
29685,There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter &amp; maybe to that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
29686,"One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either."
29687,"MB was given weeks of salary &amp; stock in appreciation for her great contribution &amp; left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist"
29688,"Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist"
29689,"Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
29690,"Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors &amp; never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so"
29691,Major increases in the Supercharger and Tesla urban charger network happening over the next several months

29696,"True, although the changemyview subreddit is least likely to be clicked on by people who really should change their view"
29697,"Arguments, followed, of course, by complaints"
29698,Are you complaining that we are not complaining enough?
29699,And let's not forget the forum on which we are posting I've heard - now this is just a rumor - that people say mean things on Twitter.
29700,Like I said ...
29701,It gets really dark
29702,"True, there are frequent complaint expansion packs"
29703,Except for complaining. That has remained constant throughout history at /100.
29704,Officially verified as the first production electric car to exceed km on a single charge! Congratulations Tesla Owners Italia!!
29705,I guess a proof of concept is needed
29706,Looking forward to launching astronauts to the International Space Station next year!

29745,A book of the most beautiful classic cars given to me on my th birthday on a farm in Saskatchewan. Van Gogh's Starry Night.
29746,$US price in $AUD plus import duties and sales tax
29747,We can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public co. Will check if possible through a feeder fund though.
29748,Often comes as a surprise when people learn that % of my time is on engineering/design and just % on other stuff
29749,A m diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories ...
29750,"Yes, I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket &amp; spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day."
29751,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.
29752,Kinda have to
29753,LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries &amp; motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
29754,"Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state &amp; city discussions."
29755,Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
29756,"An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
29757,City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
29758,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
29759,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
29760,For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
29761,Support would be much appreciated!
29762,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
29763,Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in mins.
29764,"Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship"
29765,y
29766,"True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels &amp; confused shorts."
29767,Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
29768,Not true. Email from customer.
29769,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past &amp; present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly"
29770,"Yeah, otherwise hard to find them"
29771,y
29772,"It is true, so fine by me"
29773,"Small thing (very small), but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same."
29774,It's what you don't say
29775,I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
29776,Good point
29777,Fixed. Now it's good.
29778,Yes
29779,Stay tuned
29780,I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow
29781,"Excited to announce the launch of ! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
29782,Just checked and yes
29783,"True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon . Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
29784,Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.
29785,US Senate hearing on advancing the exploration and settlement of space
29786,"We do that too, but for free"
29787,Hopefully
29788,"Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes, buying single use airplanes wd seem crazy."
29789,That doesn't sound right
29790,"Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed (""Other US"" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not."
29791,Latest S and X tires have internal acoustic foam
29792,Going over the small nuances of Model production. Very important that nothing sounds tinny.
29793,Cool!
29794,"The very near future, not, like, the far away future"
29795,"You can now drive anywhere in the US (except N Alaska), most of Europe, China &amp; Japan using the Tesla Supercharger network!"
29796,Of course!
29797,"On University Ave, above the old bakery"
29798,"One of my sons is named Xavier, after Professor X!"
29799,That's probably the best use
29800,Cool
29801,Maybe the upcoming IAC in Adelaide
29802,"It was a tough negotiation, but they seemed like good guys. I hope they kept the stock. Would be worth a lot today."
29803,"That pizza looked about as appetizing as drywall. If anything, they were doing people at the party a favor by taking it."
29804,"Wasn't wearing a suit, am def not part of a ""posse"" &amp; didn't even know Leo/Orlando were going. Just went to say hi to my friend Ken Howery."
29805,"Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back ! No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me."
29806,First Production Model
29807,"It's who is first to pay full price for the car. Hard rule. I have first Roadster and X, but not first S."
29808,"Ira Ehrenpreis had rights to st car as he was st to place a full deposit, but gave those rights to me as my th bday present. Tks Ira!"
29809,Production unit of Model is now built and going through final checkout. Pics soon.
29810,Never heard of them
29811,Stop biting my finger dammit
29812,This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of . Australia rocks!!
29813,"The world's population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care"
29814,"Thanks ! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was km, Falcon achieved km."
29815,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.
29816,We're going to spend the th doing a full review of rocket &amp; pad systems. Launch no earlier than th/6th. Only one chance to get it right
29817,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
29818,Looks like we can reach Model cars per month in Dec
29819,"Handover party for first customer Model 's on the th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be cars and Sept above ."
29820,Model passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
29821,Norway is awesome
29822,"Actually, China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things, that's where iPhones, many Android phones &amp; most laptops are made."
29823,Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good
29824,Coming later today
29825,Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed &amp; built it.
29826,Suggestions welcome!
29827,I think Einstein said that
29828,Or does the Earth move up?
29829,This is a really great floor
29830,Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.
29831,Across the road and below the ground
29832,Perspective
29833,"Nothing to be done, but wait. It's all right here:"
29834,News on Sunday
29835,Because it's off the wall
29836,Maybe it is time for the man cape to return
29837,Didn't read it. Might now though.
29838,Exactly
29839,Me too
29840,"Yes, but arguably that's worse"
29841,And I don't care who knows it. Our love will never die.
29842,Just try one. It's way better than you think.
29843,A floor that moves
29844,A ceiling is simply a floor from below
29845,Not as much as tunnels though
29846,They are so underappreciated
29847,They will never let you down
29848,I love floors
29849,Gary (the snail) is a speed demon. Long way to go before we beat him/her.
29850,"Thanks, but I am"
29851,No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
29852,"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long."
29853,"Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack &amp; peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach reentry is X Mach . Intense."
29854,They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
29855,Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it
29856,More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
29857,"Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in &lt;24 hours."
29858,Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
29859,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
29860,Still humans
29861,Significantly improves control force
29862,Launch at :25 delivering satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.
29863,"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry."
29864,"We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about years ago"
29865,"Not only that, it has all the wifis and G is coming soon"
29866,Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
29867,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
29868,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon to land in heavier winds."
29869,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
29870,"Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"
29871,Flying with larger &amp; significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast &amp; cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.
29872,Sticking to
29873,"It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace"
29874,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
29875,Falcon will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
29876,"Technically, Ironyman"
29877,Thanks! Looks cool.
29878,"Damn, I forgot bacon"
29879,"In life, there are no easy choices"
29880,Do want irony on social media?
29881,Must remember that irony and social media are not friends. Keep forgetting. Dammit.
29882,Radiation
29883,Groan
29884,"But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise"
29885,Will extend
29886,Over km should be possible in a D with the right tires
29887,Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts &amp; radiative view factor is low.
29888,"No plans to change kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model pack is about cost reduction, not performance."
29889,No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer
29890,Cool
29891,"That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention"
29892,"First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot"
29893,Calling this cueless would be generous. Much less energy required for lithium-ion batteries &amp; Gigafactory is powered by renewables anyway.
29894,No plans to change cell form factor for X and S
29895,"This is crazy, but Max Smart mentions Chaos towards the end. Coincidence?"
29896,There's a plot!?
29897,ujelly?
29898,"My real phone is an HTC Droid, which I ordered after seeing this ad"
29899,Nothing beats the shoe phone that is also a real shoe
29900,But then I get paid less
29901,"Backup valve shows no sign of leaking, but yeah"
29902,If schedule holds there will be two Falcon launches within hours (Cape &amp; Vandenberg) this weekend
29903,"Postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic valve. It is dual redundant, but not worth taking a chance."
29904,"Promising conversations with regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes &amp; pedestrians. Permits harder than technology."
29905,It's time they knew
29906,Tesla service rescues a kitten stuck in the bumper
29907,So soon you won't believe it
29908,Colonizing Mars (thanks Prof Hubbard for creating this from my talk). Major changes to the plan coming soon.
29909,"Hawthorne, California"
29910,Flying through the Falcon Factory
29911,"Mars V2 plan coming soon, which I think addresses the most fundamental flaw in V1: how to pay for development &amp; operation of giant rockets"
29912,Radar-only braking on HW1 is getting better with every release. We're hoping to do the demo where it brakes for a UFO in the fog soon.
29913,"$300M cost diff between SpaceX and Boeing/Lockheed exceeds avg value of satellite, so flying with SpaceX means satellite is basically free"
29914,In discussions with the government of India requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory is built
29915,US govt testing by finds Model X to be the safest SUV in history by significant margin
29916,"That would an interesting target. Would, of course, only count if capable of doing so right off the production line with street legal tires."
29917,How'd you know?
29918,"Linux kernel update was way harder than anticipated. Giant improvement, but meant way more OS overhead tuning to keep screen frame rate good"
29919,"New kernel goes out next weekend, new web browser next month. Radar-only braking is getting steadily better for both HW and ."
29920,HW2 Autopilot release should go wide next weekend with additional smoothness improvements to longitudinal control
29921,"We are developing the interplanetary rocket and spaceship to allow anyone to travel to the moon, Mars &amp; beyond, regardless of nationality"
29922,Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
29923,Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
29924,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly &amp; are reluctant to adopt new tech.
29925,"I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama Prob worth doing?"
29926,Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only % of parts ended up being common.
29927,"Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."
29928,"The faster, the better. Gravity losses."
29929,Damn Stonecutters!
29930,"Was no ""company"", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize ACP's Tzero car. No tech or IP, no employees &amp; didn't even own Tesla Motors name."
29931,"Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation."
29932,Exactly
29933,Congrats Robb!
29934,So crazy that people were arrested for trying to keep their cars from being destroyed
29935,You may have Heard of the person who put it together
29936,"Worth watching ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" By . Truth is indeed stranger than fiction"
29937,"If Zedd is kind enough to send me a list, it's on"
29938,"All Superchargers are being converted to solar/battery power. Over time, almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid."
29939,"I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV adoption! Great example for the rest of the world."
29940,"Long way to go, but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs &amp; gave them all our patents to help, so that's something"
29941,"Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought % prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance."
29942,"Since big car companies were killing their EV programs, the only chance was to create an EV company, even tho it was almost certain to fail"
29943,"They was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars"
29944,Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in &amp; then crushed them in a junkyard
29945,That is true. Ludicrous mode is like having pure joy on tap. Nothing else (legal) will get you that.
29946,Click the left scroll wheel to pause or mute music
29947,"Good point, will add ""cancel nav"" to voice commands"
29948,Too awesome
29949,Must ipso facto half not bee
29950,"First of all, I cracked a long time ago. That's not news. Second, yes, I can see time. How did you know?"
29951,"Yeah, car should auto play when it gets an exact match, like it does for directions. Will make that change."
29952,Just confirmed the Tesla DJ station works in Canada
29953,Cool
29954,"No, it's not!"
29955,Yes
29956,Tap cancel on the screen
29957,"Just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say ""Play Monty Python"" or ""Navigate home"" or anything. Voice commands work pretty well."
29958,"Just depends on whether you like a sedan or SUV. Sedan goes faster, SUV has more room."
29959,"Yeah, coming back"
29960,Coming soon!
29961,Partly
29962,Possibly my favorite skit
29963,Might work in Canada too
29964,I mean also
29965,Not yet
29966,Yeah
29967,"In the US, you can ask your Tesla to play any Monty Python (or other comedy) skit. Doesn't work outside US yet."
29968,"It's on the car. Might add it to the Tesla app at some point, so you get it on your phone if you have a Powerwall or Tesla solar."
29969,My favorite for sure
29970,Try the new Tesla DJ station on streaming radio
29971,The scene where Brian is saved from the Romans by falling off a tower into a spaceship is the best Deus Ex Machina moment of any movie ever
29972,"All Falcon Heavy cores should be at the Cape in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after that"
29973,Love Monty Python so much
29974,"Just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of me. That hurts, ok?"
29975,Yeah
29976,Yeah
29977,These guys want us to die so bad they can taste it
29978,Could be worse
29979,"We can either give up hope &amp; sit in traffic hell forever or try something new. The odds of success may be low, but they're better than zero."
29980,The Boring Company is in Hawthorne and has already approved the permit
29981,Thanks Such an outrageous lawsuit. People sometimes underestimate strength of US judiciary. Lot of respect for the judge &amp; jury system.
29982,Read
29983,Almost. Falcon Heavy was way harder to develop than it seemed at first.
29984,"Once you add the vintage record player, it's all good"
29985,You're welcome!
29986,"A little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien ... and magic!"
29987,A step facial treatment every morning. The mistake people make is stopping at .
29988,"And um ... not trying to brag or anything, but I think I look good for"
29989,Seems that way
29990,Of course. What base-number system were you using?
29991,That's why the pic is in black and white. Didn't have color back then.
29992,"Yeah, I counted"
29993,Tesla shareholder meeting today. Can't believe it's been years since we went public.
29994,"This is a metaphor for transparency. Also, f* underwear."
29995,Obviously
29996,"SEC disclosures, etc"
29997,"I'm not *saying* they're related, but"
29998,Or is it more about the way you use it?
29999,I hope I'm wrong
30000,"Probably closer to to imo. would be a linear extrapolation, but progress is exponential."
30001,Great comedy! They should write for .
30002,Most likely
30003,"Also, we will have a very high headcount around each Gigafactory keeping it running. They just won't be doing boring, repetitive tasks."
30004,Probably closer to four or five factories. Logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end customer.
30005,California Cabernet
30006,Wearing anything at all is just a conspiracy by the capitalist running dogs of Big Underwear
30007,He was great though
30008,Was just at the DMV &amp; dude had the actual sloth from Zootopia on his desk
30009,"Most people don't realize you can see Dragon approach the Space Station from the ground, even in LA"
30010,Proud of my Mom
30011,"Yeah, pretty much dead center. We painted the target area with radio reflective paint, which helps the radar be more precise."
30012,Exactly
30013,It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars &amp; airplanes and how it should be for rockets.
30014,First reflight of a Dragon spacecraft set for later today
30015,Good point
30016,India commits to sell only electric cars by . It is already the largest market for solar power.
30017,"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by as the US does from all sources today"
30018,Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
30019,Coming soon
30020,Yeah
30021,Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case
30022,"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH &amp; via councils, that we remain"
30023,And then some
30024,"Yeah, it was great!"
30025,Piggyback rides around the Opera House
30026,Sydney is such a beautiful city
30027,A lot
30028,"I do via my foundation, which is now years old, but my grants are (almost always) anonymous"
30029,Yes
30030,Should finish trans-Canada this year. A stop in Swift Current for sure!
30031,Yes
30032,Comparing Model S vs Model
30033,Old-school fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks
30034,There will be a combined booster static fire. Maybe a few.
30035,"Btw, that cloud is almost entirely steam, including dark parts (like a storm). This is what the launch looks like:"
30036,"Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ..."
30037,Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to people.
30038,Only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain
30039,You are right. Going at max speed. Not much time left.
30040,Busted
30041,Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.
30042,True
30043,Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me
30044,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
30045,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
30046,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
30047,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
30048,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
30049,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety"
30050,Exactly
30051,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
30052,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
30053,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
30054,Hopefully June for those too
30055,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
30056,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version ). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a ."
30057,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that % of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
30058,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
30059,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
30060,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
30061,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
30062,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off"
30063,Something cool for sure
30064,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
30065,"Model , Model X &amp; Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision &amp; control software."
30066,Wear underpants
30067,Will do
30068,Black and textured slate versions will be
30069,Yes
30070,"For reason I can't explain, I find especially odd. Also, not a fan of . Has led too many people astray in valuing securities."
30071,"Still agree with Tim's points. What ""you"" are is an evolving, mind-body pattern, but there's still a core youness that holds true over time."
30072,"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle &amp; practical limits of simultaneity in transfer make this exact thought experiment impossible, but yeah"
30073,We got stuck
30074,All the answers to questions you never asked about holes in the ground
30075,What pun?
30076,What I love about The Boring Company are the low expectations. Nowhere to go but down.

30082,And ... it's done
30083,Worked in Minecraft. Just sayin ...
30084,Of course. Why is that even a question?
30085,Imma gonna dig that tunnel with this here hammer
30086,My grandmother was from Moose Jaw
30087,Going to a barn raising!
30088,"On my cousin's farm in Canada at , wearing a hat on a hat"
30089,"Yeah, worked on the farm when I was"
30090,"Family history article. Was born in South Africa, but named after my American great-grandfather."
30091,Yes
30092,"[Warning, this may cause motion sickness or seizures] This is a test run of our electric sled"
30093,"The race between Gary, our pet snail who lives in a pineapple, and Godot, our tunnel boring"
30094,Boring machine segments have been lowered into the starter tunnel. Going through final assembly.
30095,Cutterhead in operation at standard industry speed. Planning to jack this up by a factor of ten
30096,First tunnel for The Boring Company begins ... Full length of first tunnel will run from LAX to
30097,"Entry hole, staging area and starting tunnel for Boring Machine (aka Godot) now complete"
30098,"Tesla needs to iterate fast on solar roof prefab/install technology, so all installs will be done by Tesla techs at first"
30099,Third one will be from Frost. Maybe the second.
30100,Yes. Good.
30101,"First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where."
30102,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems &amp; plays. Decided against plays &amp; poems. Too obvious.
30103,That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
30104,This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.
30105,Slo-mo hail cannonball impacting Tesla solar roof tile
30106,"Will do our best. Hopefully, yes."
30107,Yes
30108,Solar roof can be ordered for almost any country. Deployment this year in the US and overseas next year.
30109,Black glass smooth and textured will be first. Tuscan and French Slate in about six months.
30110,U.K. delivery and installation next year
30111,Yes
30112,Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about hours ...
30113,"If heat death of the universe is the destination, it really is all about the journey"
30114,It's a good one
30115,Thanks for doing it!
30116,Headed to see Guardians w my bro and kids. Loved the first one.
30117,"I do love Banks, but perhaps we should reserve his names for the droneships"
30118,Simple. I like it.
30119,Kinda like Snoop Dug
30120,I don't want to be presumptuous
30121,"I know what you're thinking then why not ""the Third""? Well, I've learned my lesson about 's."
30122,"By calling it ""the Second"", it has more credibility"
30123,"Maybe Ultimate Boring Machine, the Second"
30124,Boring Not Boring
30125,Good one
30126,Been done
30127,Thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine
30128,Was just rereading one of my favorites. So beautiful
30129,"Close-up of rocket stage separation, fast flip, boostback burn in a ring of fire and then"
30130,Landing
30131,"Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good. Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at % of the theoretical load limit."
30132,"Winds aloft are unusually high (still within structural safety bounds). Worrying, but not a showstopper."
30133,"Yeah, will probably publish an update in six weeks or so"
30134,My boring TED talk
30135,Couldn't agree more
30136,Extremely
30137,Even more boring
30138,Boring
30139,"We def want to avoid either, particularly Surface Detail ..."
30140,On it now
30141,"Great food, great ambience and with great friends. We all really enjoyed the visit."
30142,Will definitely do that on my next trip
30143,"Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard, and"
30144,That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
30145,"Yeah, sorry I missed that. This would only work for kWh packs that are software created to , so not ."
30146,Yes
30147,Tesla will soon be offering a compelling means of upgrading a to a
30148,July
30149,Pickup truck unveil in to months
30150,Next gen Roadster will be convertible
30151,Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
30152,Yeah
30153,"Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it."
30154,This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...
30155,Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest
30156,"Fairing is ~$5M, but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to %."
30157,Latency should only be min max. Checking ...
30158,Feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered Tesla Easter eggs
30159,And so the robots spared humanity ...
30160,"Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows."
30161,"Et tu, Walt?"
30162,Stormy weather in Shortville ...
30163,Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It's basically dead.
30164,It's just a helicopter in helicopter's clothing
30165,It won't matter
30166,Pretty good
30167,"Why did we waste so much time developing silly rockets? Damn you, aliens! So obtuse! You have all this crazy tech, but can't speak English!?"
30168,Technology breakthrough: turns out chemtrails are actually a message from time-traveling aliens describing the secret of teleportation
30169,"Def P100D with Ludicrous+, although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that"
30170,We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
30171,Working on it
30172,Looks like it could do % more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
30173,A lot
30174,Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend &amp; Monty Python.
30175,"Good point, odds go from % to &gt;0%"
30176,Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
30177,"Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot."
30178,Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
30179,Thanks Phil!
30180,Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within hours.
30181,"If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times"
30182,"On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance."
30183,Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model .
30184,Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
30185,No
30186,You won't care
30187,What gave me away?
30188,No
30189,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...
30190,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
30191,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
30192,Yes
30193,Yes
30194,I believe so
30195,Yup
30196,Oh so little faith
30197,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a kWh pack in Model at current cell/module energy densities
30198,Yeah
30199,Start taking orders in April
30200,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
30201,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles"
30202,The Model S produced today is arguably version . Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model arrives.
30203,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
30204,No problem
30205,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
30206,Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
30207,"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in to months."
30208,Damn straight we do! Coming with next week.
30209,First drive of a release candidate version of Model
30210,It still has one display
30211,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
30212,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
30213,How about the video we just took of the first Model release candidate drive?
30214,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
30215,I think so
30216,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
30217,Tues/Wed
30218,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
30219,Tues/Wed next week
30220,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
30221,"Yes, but not until next year"
30222,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
30223,"Sorta. Model is like a BMW series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW and series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
30224,How about now?
30225,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
30226,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
30227,Definitely
30228,"Model was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different"
30229,Yes
30230,"Model is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
30231,"Am noticing that many people think Model is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone vs . This is not true."
30232,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
30233,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
30234,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
30235,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
30236,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
30237,I hope that didn't work
30238,~spawn npc.alien
30239,Where are the %*&gt; aliens?
30240,Looks like Tues/Wed for release
30241,Except that isn't actually my house ...
30242,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
30243,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
30244,"is a great car, but definitely Model S"
30245,Good point
30246,I wish. It's so annoying.
30247,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ..."
30248,Ok
30249,"It's been a bear to get done, but prob days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
30250,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
30251,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
30252,". Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
30253,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially"
30254,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
30255,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
30256,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at
30257,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC."
30258,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.
30259,"Just spoke with , Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
30260,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
30261,$250/kWh at the pack level for MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
30262,Tesla will get the system installed and working days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
30263,Will send you one
30264,Self-hatred
30265,Thanks JJ!
30266,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!
30267,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.
30268,"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it or times ever."
30269,Fly me to the moon ... Ok
30270,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at pm PST
30271,of course
30272,maybe one of those too
30273,Roller coasters are awesome
30274,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
30275,Good chance it will
30276,Exactly
30277,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
30278,Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
30279,Excellent Tesla Model X review
30280,Just posted a video
30281,Baby came back
30282,no
30283,System was green for launch. I called it off.
30284,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp risk on Dragon , that I feel very confident of ."
30285,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
30286,"Btw, % likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that % chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
30287,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
30288,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
30289,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
30290,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast
30291,spacex's photo
30292,"Provided Dragon demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in"
30293,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
30294,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow."
30295,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
30296,It's much easier to do the CGI that way
30297,Daylight rocket launch &amp; landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.
30298,I used that one
30299,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
30300,They are doing India proud
30301,You may come to regret that request
30302,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
30303,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
30304,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
30305,"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
30306,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
30307,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited."
30308,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
30309,Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
30310,Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
30311,Falcon rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex -A. This is the same launch
30312,Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
30313,"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
30314,of course it will
30315,Should all be uploaded by next month
30316,Motor Trend could only achieve sec when they tested the Porsche
30317,I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
30318,George Schultz and Jim Baker article in regarding a carbon tax
30319,yes
30320,Hoping for summer this year
30321,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
30322,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit ."
30323,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
30324,"No plans to take X, S (or ) above kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
30325,Take out the floor mats and its . MT said everything had to be standard production.
30326,yes
30327,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to mph in sec
30328,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
30329,No rare earth metals in battery
30330,Almost ready
30331,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
30332,"Yes, but Model is the overwhelming priority"
30333,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
30334,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
30335,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
30336,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in chars and tone is lost in text"
30337,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
30338,Rolling out a new update today.
30339,We should try our best
30340,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
30341,I just had three coffees
30342,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
30343,Numeric
30344,Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
30345,"I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota."
30346,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
30347,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
30348,True. Me being one of them
30349,"Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but th out of + countries with only a diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
30350,"Fair point, sorry"
30351,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
30352,Exactly
30353,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
30354,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
30355,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
30356,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool"
30357,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
30358,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
30359,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
30360,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
30361,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
30362,Mostly anti-drug laws
30363,Exactly
30364,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
30365,The remedy for that is changing the law
30366,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
30367,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
30368,True!
30369,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
30370,Walking down the street and saw this
30371,I wish!
30372,"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
30373,"Wow, cool!"
30374,That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
30375,Nuances are important
30376,ft diameter tunnel running miles under D.C.
30377,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
30378,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
30379,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council &amp; keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
30380,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"
30381,First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
30382,maybe
30383,Video of MIT's entrant into the SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Air has been removed from the Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.
30384,Minecraft
30385,"Yes. Green cards &amp; dual citizens already ok. Work &amp; spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action."
30386,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
30387,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
30388,yes
30389,Headline &amp; article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
30390,"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
30391,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI
30392,"I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting"
30393,"Yeah, sorry about that"
30394,"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"
30395,Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material
30396,Strategic &amp; Policy Forum
30397,"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
30398,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus &amp; present to President.
30399,It is not
30400,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong &amp; don't deserve to be rejected."
30401,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the countrys challenges
30402,"This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true."
30403,And we start digging the tunnel tonight
30404,Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
30405,"Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people &amp; it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution &amp; hope good comes of it."
30406,"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway."
30407,"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the Freeway, which is mins from LAX"
30408,Yup
30409,Maybe next month
30410,Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.
30411,Rex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle.
30412,I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
30413,No they don't
30414,Was wondering what those were
30415,Sigh
30416,That may be a difficult award to decline
30417,"Tillerson also said that the risk of climate change does exist and he believed action should be taken"""

30767,Maybe as a future optimization. Would only matter if it was extremely big.
30768,as long as I'm alive
30769,Looking forward to the Gigafactory opening party on Friday next week. The scale blows me away every time I see it.
30770,Autopilot prevents serious injury or death of a pedestrian in NY (owner anecdote confirmed by vehicle logs)
30771,"Jerome is driving Tesla Semi &amp; doing a great job with his team. At Daimler, he led their most successful semi truck program ever."
30772,It's inspired by some of the California Custom VW combi design art
30773,Great game. Whole Fallout series is amazing.
30774,Both should have been done under the same corporate umbrella from the beginning
30775,"Tesla Master Plan, Part Deux"
30776,now Pac
30777,California time
30778,Post should go live on Tesla website around pm
30779,yup
30780,busted
30781,Except for the tweet about large amounts of crack (actually just small amounts)
30782,Not easy to convey irony in a tweet
30783,Lana
30784,Finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from Gatsby. Seems appropriate...
30785,"Will be working at Tesla on Autopilot &amp; Model today, then aiming to pull an all-nighter and complete the master product plan"
30786,I am!
30787,Returning from Cape Canaveral to California...
30788,"Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket"
30789,Can't wait to see all three cores of Falcon Heavy come back for landings! First two will be almost simultaneous.
30790,Landing
30791,free Babel fish provided
30792,Bit of a distraction yesterday. Working on plan today.
30793,Out on LZ-1. We just completed the post-landing inspection and all systems look good. Ready to fly again.
30794,Falcon on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
30795,"Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they're so much smarter than Tesla owners that ""they know better"". Makes no sense."
30796,"V8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day."
30797,"Tesla customers are v smart &amp; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: % want it disabled -- not %, %."
30798,"It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection"
30799,Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
30800,Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.
30801,That is a very good point!
30802,Have to focus on tonight's launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
30803,"Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla."
30804,"Promising call today with , maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update."
30805,much appreciated
30806,Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.
30807,Sensible article on Autopilot by guardian
30808,On the other hand I do answer a toy phone like it's real
30809,large amounts of crack
30810,"hours normally, but a lot less these days"
30811,Sunday is the end of the week
30812,yes
30813,good up to ~160km/h
30814,Our radar is using a wavelength of mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
30815,especially well
30816,Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
30817,"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
30818,yes
30819,certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
30820,effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
30821,elevation too
30822,only just gained access to physical vehicle
30823,AP process crash would show up in logs
30824,"Working on using existing Tesla radar by itself (decoupled from camera) w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point cloud, like lidar"
30825,"Maybe didn't realize he turned it off, but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument cluster."
30826,exactly
30827,"Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on."
30828,EU regulators find no safety concerns with Autopilot
30829,It's all fun &amp; games until ...
30830,We don't mind taking the heat for customer safety. It is the right thing to do. From
30831,can't wait to see the costume
30832,Only if I can play a monkey
30833,"Tesla finishes last in being salesy! Good. Also, I can't believe there is a real Pied Piper."
30834,Something like that
30835,already taken care of
30836,Kinda. Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery &amp; solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason
30837,I like your tweets!
30838,"Tricky in chars, but: B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that."
30839,Blog on Autopilot by
30840,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
30841,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before B.
30842,"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
30843,"With less than B miles, there simply isn't enough data. B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
30844,"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
30845,exactly
30846,"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
30847,why?
30848,thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
30849,Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
30850,"you're right, no point"
30851,"Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."
30852,"Misunderstanding of what ""beta"" means to Tesla for Autopilot: any system w less than B miles of real world driving"
30853,Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
30854,"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part . Hoping to publish later this week."
30855,"Story was fed to LAT &amp; many other media to counter IMF $5T/year fossil subsidy study. Hey, both have a !"
30856,seriously
30857,Love reddit. Gandel gets shredded &amp; won't even answer top upvoted questions. Some really funny comments about Koch
30858,"Model S had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA, which is why ..."
30859,thanks
30860,"true, good point"
30861,"No, you were misleading mostly on your own, but w many copycats. Jalopnik just lost it's sense of irony &amp; didn't get my tweet."
30862,"cool, thanks"
30863,The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
30864,"In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert."
30865,"Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert."
30866,"All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include."
30867,Tesla response to the misleading Fortune articles about Autopilot
30868,Sponsored articles
30869,Because of course I hate flamingos...(maybe try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your salad)
30870,Exactly! I love Twitter.
30871,Wrong to exclude non-occupant deaths. Autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed
30872,"If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about M+/year deaths from other auto companies?"
30873,"Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market."
30874,Radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
30875,Our condolences for the tragic loss
30876,Shakespeare. Then love-devouring death do what he dare; It is enough I may but call her mine.
30877,aspirationally
30878,"My son recently asked what my favorite animal was. Well, of course"
30879,Thoughtful analysis of the Tesla/SolarCity merger by
30880,Thanks for the kind bday wishes!
30881,cute!
30882,exactly
30883,We haven't signed anything for a factory in China
30884,"Deluded, deranged, etc. Journalistic thesaurus sure got a lot of use last week ..."
30885,"Article is misleading to readers. No one is ""taking home"" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table."
30886,Of course. Our love will never die.
30887,This is going to be great
30888,Drive units and battery are sealed
30889,"If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential"
30890,"We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation."
30891,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side
30892,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. is the year of experimentation."
30893,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
30894,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
30895,Thanks Tyler
30896,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
30897,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
30898,Quite rapid... Yes
30899,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly
30900,Looks like thrust was low on of landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
30901,"Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship"
30902,Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll
30903,"Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will."
30904,"Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely."
30905,No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
30906,Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
30907,"That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics"
30908,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
30909,Latest science predicts &gt; trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens
30910,"Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious."
30911,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
30912,"Of greater concern: of suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
30913,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
30914,That is correct. It was about innovation.
30915,Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on
30916,no
30917,Something about a flying metal suit...
30918,yes
30919,S and X cells are also Panasonic
30920,Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
30921,Fourth rocket arrives in the hangar. Aiming for first reflight in Sept/Oct.
30922,"PC, of course"
30923,Highly recommend by the good people of if you like ultrafast team FPS action
30924,Trippy
30925,I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
30926,Exactly
30927,Good article from explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to Tesla funding
30928,how did you know?
30929,Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
30930,exactly
30931,It is simulations all the way down
30932,"At this point, I'm really running out of crazy things to say. Any suggestions?"
30933,control of super powerful AI by a small number of humans is the most proximate concern
30934,Just heard that Norway will ban new sales of fuel cars in . What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!!
30935,"Yay, baby made it home!"
30936,autosteering chutes will be added soon
30937,Recode interview with and via
30938,Supercharger policy explained well by : Will post detailed description soon. I think it's a good balance.
30939,Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by
30940,Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this &amp; investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
30941,So it was good for you too ...
30942,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
30943,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
30944,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
30945,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
30946,Satellite deployed to km apogee. All looks good.
30947,mins to launch
30948,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
30949,Really fun Model X review by . Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car
30950,"Flight is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
30951,Great image of ancient Mars
30952,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
30953,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
30954,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
30955,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
30956,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
30957,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
30958,Full height of Falcon boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
30959,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon , but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
30960,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises
30961,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
30962,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
30963,yes
30964,yup
30965,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
30966,Three's company
30967,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
30968,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.
30969,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!
30970,tambin te amo
30971,It's probably the Ambien
30972,Definitely
30973,Ok
30974,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.
30975,coming soon
30976,Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
30977,I think so
30978,Max is just X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
30979,I love you too!
30980,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to km above Earth"
30981,Thank goodness all are ok
30982,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
30983,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
30984,Woohoo!!
30985,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
30986,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model soon if you want delivery"
30987,yes
30988,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant &amp; measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.
30989,Bioweapon Defense Mode is real This is what happens when you turn it on:
30990,"Have been reviewing end of line production quality personally. Slowed things down temporarily, but it's for the best."
30991,Historical precedent. Mars vehicle will be metric.
30992,next month (with a lot of other good stuff)
30993,exactly
30994,"sides def, center maybe"
30995,naturally
30996,Falcon Heavy thrust will be M lbf at liftoff -- twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
30997,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to M lbf later this year. It is capable of M lbf in flight.
30998,F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be kg
30999,"No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
31000,No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
31001,Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract % to % for reusable booster payload.
31002,"Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce sigma reserve margin."
31003,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon and Heavy
31004,yes
31005,turns out it doesn't need securing
31006,yes
31007,"yes, several times"
31008,for sure
31009,things like this should be purged shortly
31010,+ for almost everything + for heat shields and a few other items.
31011,Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
31012,"JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
31013,System scan detected only % of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
31014,of course
31015,Temporary spike in some areas due to X rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
31016,"Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are , so speculation unlikely."
31017,Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
31018,checking into it ...
31019,will definitely do so
31020,"some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
31021,"It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
31022,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
31023,Dragon is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
31024,"A should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
31025,That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
31026,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well
31027,"Aiming for relaunch in to months, pending detailed examination and X refiring of a returned booster"
31028,We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.
31029,By land and sea
31030,Will be interesting to see what the meantime to Hitler is for these bots. Only took Microsoft's Tay a day.
31031,Owner video of Autopilot steering to avoid collision with a truck
31032,Godot Full play
31033,"Have recently come to appreciate the awesome, absurdist humor of Waiting for Godot. We so often wait, without knowing why, when or where."
31034,me too!
31035,Great video history of Falcon by Kinematic
31036,needs latest update
31037,"Activate autopilot X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon."
31038,"Not from us, but it's awesome"
31039,"Well, I thought TLI might be upset about using their material without permission. Apparently not"
31040,Thanks
31041,yes
31042,"Tickets to orbital hotels, the moon and Mars will be a lot less than people think."
31043,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation for all those who have supported Tesla, SpaceX &amp; SolarCity over the years. Thank you."
31044,Thanks on behalf of an amazing team at SpaceX!
31045,Thanks!
31046,Thanks for your support! Looking forward to delivering the goods for you.
31047,"Screen cap from the stern cam of droneship ""Of Course I Still Love You"""
31048,"Reasons for ocean landing are technical, not economic. Orbit requires extreme horizontal velocity. Getting to space needs none."
31049,SolarCity panels produce enough zero carbon energy to charge entire Tesla fleet
31050,Nickel is also in nickels
31051,"Battery uses no rare Earth metals. Main ingredient is nickel, which is what's used to coat cutlery, so very non-toxic."
31052,"Over k cars or ~$14B in preorders in first week. Only % ordered max of two, suggesting low levels of speculation."
31053,the only thing beyond ludicrous is plaid
31054,"yes, will go all the way to Alaska"
31055,"Dex will do comms, but my speeches are just a conversation w the audience. No time to rehearse &amp; don't want to read from a prompter."
31056,we will
31057,Doesn't sound right. Will check into it.
31058,We are working on enlarging the opening. Aperture will be big enough for almost anything.
31059,Most telling is that the SpaceX Propulsion CTO switched from driving a Porsche Turbo S to a Model X
31060,Model X review
31061,probably unwise
31062,"won't be a hatchback, but we should be able to increase the opening width and height"
31063,yes
31064,yes
31065,yes
31066,yes
31067,sounds good
31068,"Signing off from impromptu Twitter AMA. Thanks for the suggestions. Btw, we really will have more cow bells."
31069,Coming soon for all Tesla cars. Just an OTA software update.
31070,"yes, coming this year"
31071,Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
31072,you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for .
31073,correct
31074,hopefully
31075,what's the link to that?
31076,"No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
31077,no problem
31078,Will cover whole country hopefully this year
31079,"yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
31080,less
31081,torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
31082,"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
31083,"Model will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
31084,yes
31085,Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
31086,definitely
31087,should be addressed this year
31088,Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
31089,that's not the real steering system
31090,yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
31091,Some tweaking underway
31092,Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the . It feels like a spaceship.
31093,Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
31094,Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
31095,They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
31096,It will make sense after part of the Model unveil
31097,"A Model order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
31098,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
31099,We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
31100,There will be an optional tow hitch.
31101,Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
31102,Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
31103,"cool, thanks!"
31104,"Yes, if the trend continues, before"
31105,k Model orders by end of Sat
31106,Model design sketches
31107,"We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before production starts."
31108,They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
31109,"Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for . They deserve a lot of credit."
31110,"we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
31111,"yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
31112,and a few other things
31113,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe -30 people per store would line up, not . Gifts on order."
31114,Maybe /4 to /2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part of the unveil.
31115,"Will give an update tonight for the day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."

31155,The AEI meeting wasn't secret and I was only there for a few hours to talk about Mars and sustainable energy. Nothing to do with Trump.
31156,Congrats to DeepMind! Many experts in the field thought AI was years away from achieving this.
31157,"SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service."
31158,"SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory."
31159,Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.

31164,Evolution hasn't advanced much
31165,MIT Technology Review
31166,checking ...
31167,exactly
31168,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
31169,Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
31170,Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
31171,AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
31172,"Great leg room for rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
31173,"yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
31174,"Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick seats unless you really need ."
31175,"That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
31176,Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
31177,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.
31178,Next gen Atlas robot

31180,"There is no way it is only %, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as %."
31181,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or % for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
31182,Just wanted to thank Stu G for . Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.
31183,Don't you already have a spaceship?
31184,Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs
31185,Sigh
31186,Hi
31187,"yeah, that's a great one too"
31188,Little bit

31190,My coffee tastes unusually good this morning
31191,yes
31192,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
31193,"yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
31194,This baby Model S really is quite fun
31195,More details on Model unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
31196,yes
31197,No signature series for Model . Same reservation amount for all.
31198,global
31199,Model reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March and online April
31200,good point
31201,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
31202,Love this Tesla video made by
31203,My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret
31204,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
31205,Interesting name
31206,I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
31207,"My best guess for : ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in"
31208,Thanks Jeff
31209,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it"
31210,"Stage would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
31211,"Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
31212,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
31213,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
31214,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
31215,steel collet
31216,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing."
31217,probably
31218,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
31219,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
31220,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
31221,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine showed thrust fluctuations."
31222,Next launch is a science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.
31223,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions
31224,Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
31225,"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
31226,"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."

31234,There and back again
31235,Thanks Jon!
31236,"satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
31237,Background on the launch
31238,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at :33pm local tmrw
31239,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a % higher chance of a good landing. Punting hrs.
31240,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
31241,Meant to reply to this article:
31242,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
31243,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
31244,Rounding up to sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence
31245,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by secs for next attempt.
31246,About mins from static fire
31247,holding for issue resolution
31248,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
31249,mins from static fire test
31250,"yes, from F to F"
31251,It worked in Texas
31252,F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
31253,Falcon is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
31254,Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
31255,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate
31256,Announcing formation of
31257,Aiming for Falcon rocket static fire at Cape Canaveral on the th and launch about three days later
31258,Agreed. Working on it.
31259,wow
31260,Best of luck to the Cygnus launch
31261,Nice ride! Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.
31262,Good summary of my talk in Paris on climate change
31263,About to give a talk at the Sorbonne
31264,"Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
31265,But credit for st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 And Burt Rutan for commercial
31266,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began . Orbital water landing . Orbital land landing next.
31267,"Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did suborbital flights years ago &amp; is still around."
31268,The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
31269,"Getting to space needs ~Mach , but GTO orbit requires ~Mach . The energy needed is the square, i.e. units for space and for orbit."
31270,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by"
31271,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
31272,"Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
31273,Yeah and hell yeah
31274,From anywhere
31275,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.
31276,We are looking for hardcore software engineers. No prior experience with cars required. Please include code sample or link to your work.
31277,"Ramping up the Autopilot software team at Tesla to achieve generalized full autonomy. If interested, contact autopilot.com."
31278,definitely aliens!
31279,Current production is LTE. Can be upgraded by service.
31280,well done!
31281,noted
31282,"Wow, that's great!"
31283,Model S Ludicrous Mode achieves sec -60 mph and sec /4 mile in Motor Trend test
31284,"yes, comes with each car"
31285,"Compliment from Jeffrey is much appreciated, but the people of Tesla deserve all the credit"
31286,I should clarify that is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
31287,Cool!
31288,"Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
31289,"Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term."
31290,"Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
31291,Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
31292,We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
31293,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
31294,Model is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
31295,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.
31296,"important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
31297,Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
31298,"Autopilot coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"
31299,"Regulatory approvals received, so Autopilot rolling out to all countries! (Excluding Japan, which is still under review)"
31300,all
31301,Hoping for Friday release
31302,Good feedback. Will write up a list of software priorities in the coming weeks.

31770,"Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk."
31771,"Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch."
31772,Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
31773,We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
31774,"If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt"
31775,"Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ..."

31896,"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
31897,"Even if the answer is only on the order of %, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
31898,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
31899,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
31900,Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round
31901,"Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety"

31916,"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money"
31917,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
31918,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
31919,The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.

31924,"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad."
31925,"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (), who lives in NC"
31926,Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.

31929,"We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't."
31930,"And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?"

32633,"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
32634,"Even if the answer is only on the order of %, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
32635,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
32636,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
32637,Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round
32638,"Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety"
32639,Exactly
32640,"In reality, % of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change"
32641,"Climate change deniers claim ""scientists disagree"", same rebuttal used by tobacco industry about lung cancer for decades"
32642,"Good article on ""Climate Change"" vs ""Global Warming"" referred by"
32643,"Was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix."
32644,"Had a minor operation, so am in bed in meds. Probably shouldn't be tweeting"
32645,Sign of a good design is that it feels and is much bigger on inside than looks on outside
32646,Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
32647,"Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension &amp; mega torque."
32648,"Technically, I ""got rich"" from Zip2 &amp; PayPal w zero govt anything, then put % of that into SpaceX, Tesla &amp; SolarCity."
32649,"If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds."
32650,"Carbon produced by a rocket flight is roughly equal to one flight. No, we should not be exempt."
32651,"Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems."
32652,"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
32653,"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money"
32654,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
32655,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
32656,The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
32657,"Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first years, got IPO+ govt money for , now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
32658,"There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census."
32659,"Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases."
32660,"Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide."
32661,"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad."
32662,"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (), who lives in NC"
32663,Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.
32664,Making rockets
32665,Don't like having a zillion tweets in the log. Makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history.
32666,"We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't."
32667,"And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?"
32668,Those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong
32669,"More importantly, failed to pay back $1.3B. Apart those points, you were totally st"
32670,"As many have already noted, is a division of Fiat, an Italian company. We specifically said first *US* company."
32671,Interview with about Tesla and DOE loan gets into some of the details
32672,Tesla wired the funds to repay the DOE loan today. Only US car company to have fully repaid govt
32673,Physics
32674,I'm a big fan of ultracapacitors. Was going to do my PhD at Stanford on them. But we need a breakthrough in energy density...
32675,High pressure helium pneumatic bolts and pistons. No explosives.
32676,"Cool, will get one plus another chicken"
32677,You're welcome. It did seem like the chicken of destiny xx
32678,Petting zoo left a chicken behind at the park. Now we have a pet chicken.
32679,Soon Model S will feature druidic dwarves dancing around a miniature stone henge
32680,"Well, you see, by making it go to , that makes it louder than loud"
32681,Supercharger announcement pushed to next week. Something else this week.
32682,"physics + a broad range of engineering. Worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history."
32683,"Yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the Model S"
32684,we do
32685,"Harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change"
32686,"Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon &amp; Peter Rive &amp; their awesome team. I'm just a small part."
32687,Over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
32688,Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained.
32689,It can do hands free right now. Being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add...
32690,"Mostly water or coffee at home. When I'm out, will have Macallan neat or vodka with something."
32691,It can dig up almost anything.
32692,"Yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. Requires hardware unfortunately."
32693,"Given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story"
32694,"Tesla software knits together Google Voice, Slacker, Gracenote &amp; others and streams over G (will be LTE later)"
32695,"People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don't know if true, but he sure behaves that way."
32696,"Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python."
32697,"Hold down voice button &amp; say ""Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic"". Model S can play almost any song via Internet."
32698,Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part of the trilogy.
32699,There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
32700,Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
32701,Stay tuned
32702,"Just want to say thanks to customers &amp; investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you."
32703,Thanks Bill!
32704,"Am a fan of Larry, Sergey &amp; Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here"
32705,"Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck"
32706,exactly
32707,"Creating an autopilot for cars at Tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. Still a few years from production."
32708,Tested it myself this weekend and was working well. Some songs have licensing prohibiting direct request.
32709,"Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!"
32710,Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla
32711,"Yup, it is super far. Moon is basically in our back yard relative to Mars."
32712,"Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places."
32713,"Yeah, that probably makes sense."
32714,Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time.
32715,"yes, that has been the goal from the beginning"
32716,"It can definitely strain relationships, but I loved doing my first company with my brother"
32717,Norway rocks!
32718,"Earnings call next week, then Supercharger week after and then... the mystery announcement/demonstration"
32719,you're welcome
32720,we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
32721,Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good?
32722,"Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system."
32723,Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
32724,"Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners."
32725,Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry
32726,Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky
32727,"We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway."
32728,"Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform."
32729,"Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better."
32730,"The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about degrees to deploy"
32731,More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
32732,We did a ton of testing until they could handle X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
32733,High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.
32734,"F9R (pronounced F-niner) shows a little leg. Design is a nested, telescoping piston w A frame."
32735,This is about getting a prior announcement right. Not part yet.
32736,Time to up the ante (and fix some mistakes). Tesla announcement tomorrow.
32737,"We're aiming for late , but NASA needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. Would do the same"

32739,Cool
32740,Just read it. Good piece.
32741,Maybe a v long time from now. Paying div is a sign that a company cannot find good ways to spend money.
32742,"Our software is requesting the right song, but Slacker has a bug in their code. Supposed to be fixed by tomorrow."
32743,Interesting piece
32744,Auto Dealer Sterling McCall makes the case for Tesla direct sales in Texas

32747,"Am for good public transit in LA, but the pace of that construction makes the look fast."
32748,This argument is a bit silly. A city will not grow to infinite size just because there isn't traffic.
32749,"Cool, thanks for buying our car!"
32750,"Thanks, important clarification. Tesla announcements are always about making product experience better. Market follows eventually."
32751,Announcement of new strategy tomorrow. Tesla owners will like this.
32752,Cool. Just read and watched!
32753,Seems to be some stormy weather over in Shortville these days
32754,Exactly. DMV Comm overruled good recommendation of Hearing Officer.
32755,Please contact DMV Commissioner and Governor. This is not good for the people of Virginia.
32756,"Not all good news. Virginia DMV Commissioner just denied Tesla a dealer license, despite Hearing Officer being in favor."
32757,we have great neighbors!

32772,"Interesting... ""Putin unveils $50B drive for Russian space supremacy "" via"
32773,Stay tuned for a big Supercharger announcement in a few weeks. Definitely have you covered.
32774,Thanks! Hearing from constituents is super important to counteract the influence of the dealer lobby.
32775,"New York judge states: ""... dealers cannot utilize the Franchised Dealer Act as a means to sue their competitors"". Exactly!"
32776,"New York judge just ruled in favor Tesla, dismissing the legal attack by auto dealers to prevent direct sales!"
32777,Yay for democracy! asks: Should Tesla Motors be able to sell directly to consumers?
32778,"Yup, you're right"
32779,Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in Austin. Will hang around after press conf to thank people in person.
32780,"already partly here with rocket development, but will make it a lot bigger with the launch site"
32781,Just had Texas BBQ for lunch in Capitol Building. About to head to House Committee hearing to advocate for Tesla in TX.
32782,In TX to make the case for allowing Tesla to sell cars. Pls come to Capitol Room E2.014 at :30!
32783,Which leads me to my next subject of gun control ... just kidding
32784,No more political comments for me now that I've shot off both my feet.
32785,"When a person dies, the right thing to do is remember the good more than the bad. Not a day for hate (if there is ever such)."
32786,"At the risk of losing more ""cool points"", I like Reagan too! However, I also like Obama, Clinton &amp; JFK. Good people on both sides..."
32787,"Am not trying to accumulate cool points. She was far from perfect, but her actions, on balance, were good."
32788,"Her later years are debatable, but her early years are not imo. Britain went from dreary to Great again."
32789,"Always admired Margaret Thatcher -- she was tough, but sensible &amp; fair, much like my English Nana"
32790,We went through literally hundreds of variants of red trying to find something original that didn't suck.
32791,"Do all the intro courses for mech, EE, aero and physics, then specialize in the one you like most."
32792,New Tesla red going down assembly line for the first time. We spent a lot of time on this color!

32797,We are working hard to make that happen!
32798,Should be late for US and early for Europe.
32799,July!
32800,Am headed to TX next week to thank people personally for supporting Tesla. Please head to SB am tomorrow
32801,Certainly true that many people believe that Tesla and SpaceX are powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive
32802,Today's Tesla announcement is actually the nd in a part trilogy (love Douglas Adams)
32803,You never know ...
32804,Thanks Michael. Beauty of over the air software updates is that the product keeps improving even after you buy it.
32805,Thanks Jeremy! Good seeing you in LA. Awesome job with Yelp!
32806,"To be clear, Tesla is in California, so it is not April Fool's yet! Also, some may differ, but imo the Tues news is arguably more important."
32807,First profitable Q for Tesla thanks to awesome customers &amp; hard work by a super dedicated team
32808,About to do chocolate egg hunt with all the kids. Candy bonanza! Happy Easter!

32823,"There's crazy, there's batsh*t crazy, then there's North Korea crazy..."
32824,It will be slightly smaller w fewer features as std. Think Audi A4 or BMW vs Model S being S7 or M5
32825,yep
32826,sure
32827,. Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.
32828,"But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride"
32829,. $30k in $ (ie + inflation) w + mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.
32830,". It has always been my dream to produce a low cost, compelling electric car. We are to years away. Wish it could be sooner."

32881,Testing the Model S on a surface of pure ice and snow
32882,"Btw, more free East Coast Superchargers coming soon. Will allow lower initial charge, v high speed trip &amp; long detours, like NYTimes drive."
32883,"Yeah, Top Gear pretended the Tesla Roadster ran out of charge and they had to push it home. Logs showed miles range left."
32884,Thanks Tom! Support of real Tesla customers like yourself who drive the car every day is v much appreciated.
32885,"Tesla data logging is only turned on with explicit written permission from customers, but after Top Gear BS, we always keep it on for media."
32886,"Tesla blog coming soon detailing what actually happened on Broder's NYTimes ""range test"". Also lining up other journalists to do same drive."
32887,NYTimes article about Tesla range in cold is fake. Vehicle logs tell true story that he didn't actually charge to max &amp; took a long detour.

32896,My thoughts on the nature of the issue with the battery pack supplied to Boeing
32897,Desire to help Boeing is real &amp; am corresponding w chief engineer. Junod's Esquire article had high fiction content.
32898,"Maybe already under control, but Tesla &amp; SpaceX are happy to help with the lithium ion batteries."
32899,What it feels like to ride a rocket
32900,"To be super clear, I don't wish to (nor could I) mandate anything about a Mars Colony. Am just working on the tech to get people there."
32901,"Also, I am not the kale eating overlord of Mars (altho kale has its moments)"
32902,"Nice story about a Model S coast to coast road trip. By end of year, it will be Superchargers all the way!"
32903,This gives a sense of what Mars would look like after changing the climate to sustain life
32904,Death Valley restored to position of world's hottest place
32905,CA's Death Valley is again! Tesla hot weather testing was done there. Model S was fine but gas tow truck overheated.
